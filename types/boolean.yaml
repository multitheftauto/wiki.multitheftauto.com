  A *boolean* or *bool* is a datatype whose value can be either *true* or *false*. These are often returned by functions to indicate whether the operation was successful or not.

  Using the Lua functions `tostring()` and `type()` can help you to find out what datatype something is:

  ```lua
  local theReturn = isPedDead(getRandomPlayer())
  outputChatBox("The return was: "..tostring(theReturn)) -- Will say: "true" or "false"
  outputChatBox("The datatype of this return was: "..type(theReturn)) -- Will say "boolean"
  ```

  Reversing booleans:

  ```lua
  bool = true
  -- if you want to reverse it you can either do
  bool = false
  -- or
  bool = not bool
  ```
