  description: |
    This function adds the given [[ACL]] to the given [ACL group](/reference/aclgroup). This makes the resources and players in the given ACL group have access to what's specified in the given ACL. The rights for something in the different ACL's in a group are OR-ed together, which means if one ACL gives access to something, this ACL group will have access to that.
