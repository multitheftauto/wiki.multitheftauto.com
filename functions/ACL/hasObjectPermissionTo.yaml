server:
  name: hasObjectPermissionTo
  description: |
    This function returns whether or not the given object has access to perform the given action.<br/><br/>
    Scripts frequently wish to limit access to features to particular users. The na√Øve way to do this would be to check if the player who is attempting to perform an action is in a particular group (usually the Admin group).
    The main issue with doing this is that the Admin group is not guaranteed to exist. It also doesn't give the server admin any flexibility.
    He might want to allow his 'moderators' access to the function you're limiting access to, or he may want it disabled entirely.
