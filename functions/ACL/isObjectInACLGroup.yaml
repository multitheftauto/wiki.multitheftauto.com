    content: You must NOT to use this function to limit features to users that belong
      to specific groups. Instead you MUST use hasObjectPermissionTo . Using this
      function forces the server owner to name their group a certain way, whereas
      using hasObjectPermissionTo allows the owner to give permission for whatever
      features you restrict to whatever groups they have set up in their ACL.
