  name: setWeaponRenderEnabled
  description: This function allows you to completely disable/enable GTA weapon rendering
    for [ped](/wiki/Ped "Ped") and [player](/wiki/Player "Player"). It is particularly
    useful for creating custom weapon systems, where singular weapon ID could have
    many different models/variations, or to simply get rid of one frame delay when
    switching weapons.
  parameters: []
  examples:
  - path: examples/setWeaponRenderEnabled-1.lua
    description: This example disables weapon rendering once resource has started.
    side: client
  notes:
  - type: info
    content: If you want to selectively hide weapons use engineSetModelLODDistance
      with weapon model ID and value of 0.001 . Do note that game will still process
      default rendering regardless, which isn't the case when using this function
      to hide weapon models.
  - type: tip
    content: You can use it for example with optimized bone_attach resource called
      pAttach .
