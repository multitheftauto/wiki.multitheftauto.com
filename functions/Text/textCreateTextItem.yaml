  description: This function creates a text item. A text item represents a single
    area of text, much like a label does in standard GUI programming. A text item
    can only be seen by players if it is added to a [textdisplay](/wiki/Textdisplay
    "Textdisplay") using [textDisplayAddText](/wiki/TextDisplayAddText "TextDisplayAddText").
    Each text item can be added to multiple displays, if need be.
