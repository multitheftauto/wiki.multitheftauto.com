  description: This function sets the priority for a text item. Priority is the importance
    of sending updated text to the client. The system is implemented as 3 queues,
    with the *high* queue being emptied before the *medium* queue is processed, and
    with one update sent per server frame. Hence, if you set all your text items to
    *medium* priority it has the same effect as if you set them all to *high* or *low*.
  parameters:
  - name: theTextItem
    type: textitem
    description: The text item you wish to set priority to.
