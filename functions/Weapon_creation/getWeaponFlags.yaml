      effect invisible or not. flags : returns the flags used to get where the gun
      shoots at. These flags are (by order): checkBuildings : allows the shoot to
      be blocked by GTA''s internally placed buildings, i.e. the world map. checkCarTires
      : allows the shoot to be blocked by vehicle tires. checkDummies : allows the
      shoot to be blocked by GTA''s internal dummies. These are not used in the current

      shoot to be blocked by objects . checkPeds : allows the shoot to be blocked
      by peds and players . checkVehicles : allows the shoot to be blocked by vehicles
      . checkSeeThroughStuff : allows the shoot to be blocked by translucent game

      by things that can be shot through. instant_reload : if enabled, the weapon

      the weapon range distance. shoot_if_blocked : if enabled, the weapon still fires
      its target even if it''s blocked by something.'
