      : makes the weapon and muzzle effect invisible or not. flags : configures the
      flags used to get where the gun shoots at. They are based on processLineOfSight
      ''s. You have to specify all the eight flags for the function to succeed. These
      flags are (by order): checkBuildings : allows the shoot to be blocked by GTA''s
      internally placed buildings, i.e. the world map. checkCarTires : allows the
      shoot to be blocked by vehicle tires. checkDummies : allows the shoot to be
      blocked by GTA''s internal dummies. These are not used in the current MTA version
      so this argument can be set to false . checkObjects : allows the shoot to be
      blocked by objects . checkPeds : allows the shoot to be blocked by peds and
      players . checkVehicles : allows the shoot to be blocked by vehicles . checkSeeThroughStuff
      : allows the shoot to be blocked by translucent game objects, e.g. glass. checkShootThroughStuff
      : allows the shoot to be blocked by things that can be shot through. instant_reload
      : if enabled, the weapon will reload instantly rather than waiting the reload
      time until shooting again. shoot_if_out_of_range : if enabled, the weapon will
      still fire its target beyond the weapon range distance. shoot_if_blocked : if
      enabled, the weapon will still fire its target even if it''s blocked by something.'

  notes:
  - type: info
    content: Do not confuse this function with setWeaponProperty . Although setWeaponProperty
      works with player-held weapons and custom weapons (in a limited extent), this
      function does not work with player-held weapons.
  issues:
  - id: 8686
    description: setWeaponFlags(weapon, "flags") always returns false, but getWeaponFlags(weapon,
      "flags") works correctly
