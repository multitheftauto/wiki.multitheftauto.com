client:
  name: setWeaponFlags
  description: This function sets a [custom weapon](/wiki/Element/Weapon "Element/Weapon")
    flags, used to change how it behaves or finds a possible target to shoot.
  parameters: []
  examples:
  - path: examples/setWeaponFlags-1.lua
    description: This example creates a minigun that will kill any player who approaches
      the center of the map, no matter if he takes cover or not.
    side: client
  pair: getWeaponFlags
  notes:
  - type: info
    content: Do not confuse this function with setWeaponProperty . Although setWeaponProperty
      works with player-held weapons and custom weapons (in a limited extent), this
      function does not work with player-held weapons.
  issues:
  - id: '8686'
    description: setWeaponFlags(weapon, "flags") always returns false, but getWeaponFlags(weapon,
      "flags") works correctly
