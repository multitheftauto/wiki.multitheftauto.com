  description: This function returns a hash of the entire file in the specified algorithm.
    This function *does not* move the file pointer/position. Beware though, there
    will always be a minuscule period of time between checking the hash and loading
    the contents of the file, which can be abused by a potential attacker to modify
    the contents.
  parameters: []
  examples:
  - path: examples/fileGetHash-1.lua
    description: This example opens the code.lua file, computes the hash with every
      algorithm, and then displays them.
