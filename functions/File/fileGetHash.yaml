  name: fileGetHash
  description: |
    This function returns a hash of the entire file in the specified algorithm.
    This function does not move the file pointer/position. Beware though, there will always be a minuscule period of time between checking the hash and loading the contents of the file, which can be abused by a potential attacker to modify the contents.

  version:
    added: 1.6.0 r23289
  parameters:
    - name: theFile
      type: file
      description: A handle to the file you wish to get the hash from. Use [[fileOpen]] to obtain this handle.

      type: string
      description: |
        A string which must be one of these: **"md5", "sha1", "sha224", "sha256", "sha384", "sha512", "hmac"**.

      description: |
        A [[table]] with options and other necessary data for the algorithm, as detailed below.
