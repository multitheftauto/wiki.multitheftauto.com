    note: Static method [File](file).open() can also be used. Using [File](file)(...) to open a file will attempt to create the file, if it doesn't exist.
  description: Opens an existing file for reading and writing.
  parameters:
    - name: 'filePath'
      type: 'string'
      description: |
        The [Filepath](/reference/Filepath) of the file in the following format: `:resourceName/path`. `resourceName` is the name of the resource the file is in, and 'path' is the path from the root directory of the resource to the file.
        For example, if there is a file named `coolObjects.txt` in the resource `objectSearch`, it can be opened from another resource this way: `fileOpen(":objectSearch/coolObjects.txt")`.
        If the file is in the current resource, only the file path is necessary, e.g. `fileOpen("coolObjects.txt")`.
    - name: 'readOnly'
      type: 'bool'
      description: By default, the file is opened with reading and writing access. You can specify true for this parameter if you only need reading access.
      default: 'false'
  returns:
    description: If successful, returns a [[file]] handle for the file. Otherwise returns **false** (f.e. if the file doesn't exist).
