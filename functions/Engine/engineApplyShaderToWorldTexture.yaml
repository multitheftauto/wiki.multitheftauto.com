  name: engineApplyShaderToWorldTexture
  pair: engineRemoveShaderFromWorldTexture
  description: This function applies a [[shader]] to one or more
    world textures.
  parameters:
  - name: shader
    type: element
    description: The shader which is to be applied.
  - name: textureName
    type: string
    description: The name of the world texture to apply the shader to. Wildcard matching
      e.g. `"ro?ds*"` can be used to apply to more than one texture at a time.
  - name: targetElement
    type: element
    description: The element to restrict applying the shader to. If this is not set
      the shader will be applied to everything using the texture name. Valid element
      types for targetElement are [[vehicle]], [[object]] and [[ped]].
    default: nil
  - name: appendLayers
    type: bool
    description: Allows two or more layered shaders to be applied in the same texture.
      You may want to modify the **DepthBias** in the technique pass to avoid [Z-fighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-fighting)
      artifacts when using this.
    default: 'true'
  examples:
  - path: examples/engineApplyShaderToWorldTexture-1.lua
    description: This example will replace the texture of a group of common explosions
      (grenades, rockets, etc) with a custom explosion effect.
  - path: examples/engineApplyShaderToWorldTexture-2.lua
    description: This example will apply a shader to the `des_logwall` world texture
      (which is used by the house near the 'play' gamemode spawn point).
  - path: examples/engineApplyShaderToWorldTexture-3.lua
    description: This example will apply a shader to the current vehicle of the local player.
  - path: examples/engineApplyShaderToWorldTexture_OOP-1.lua
    description: This example will replace the texture of a water with a custom one.
    oop: true
  returns:
    values:
    - type: bool
      name: result
    description: Returns **true** if the shader was successfully applied, **false** otherwise.

      - The resource [shader_tex_names](/articles/shaders#texture-names) can help in finding the names of world textures.
      - When replacing the texture for a ped using the CJ skin, set **textureName** to `CJ`.
      - The shader inherits the render states of the original when it is drawn, so texture stage 0 will already be set to the original texture.
      - When using with a [[ped]], ensure you have set **ped** or **all** in the `elementTypes` when calling [[dxCreateShader]].
      - CJ body parts textures can be replaced by using: `cj_ped_head`, `cj_ped_hat`, `cj_ped_torso`, `cj_ped_legs`, `cj_ped_feet`, `cj_ped_glasses`, `cj_ped_necklace`, `cj_ped_watch` and `cj_ped_extra1`.
