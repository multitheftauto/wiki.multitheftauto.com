  notes:
  - type: tip
    content: 'The resource shader_tex_names can help in finding the names of world
      textures. When replacing the texture for a ped using the CJ skin, set textureName
      to "CJ" The shader inherits the render states of the original when it is drawn,
      so texture stage 0 will already be set to the original texture. When using with
      a ''ped'', ensure you have set ''ped'' or ''all'' in the elementTypes when calling
      dxCreateShader CJ body parts textures can be replaced by using: "cj_ped_head",
      "cj_ped_hat", "cj_ped_torso", "cj_ped_legs", "cj_ped_feet", "cj_ped_glasses",
      "cj_ped_necklace", "cj_ped_watch" and "cj_ped_extra1". Latest version of shader_tex_names
      will show what is being used.'
