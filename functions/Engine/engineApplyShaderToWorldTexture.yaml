  description: This function applies a [shader](/wiki/Shader "Shader") to one or more
    world textures.
  parameters:
  - name: shader
    type: element
    description: The shader which is to be applied
  - name: textureName
    type: string
    description: The name of the world texture to apply the shader to. Wildcard matching
      e.g. "ro?ds*" can be used to apply to more than one texture at a time.
  - name: targetElement
    type: element
    description: The element to restrict applying the shader to. If this is not set
      the shader will be applied to everything using the texture name. Valid element
      types for targetElement are vehicles , objects and peds .
    default: nil
  - name: appendLayers
    type: bool
    description: allows two or more layered shaders to be applied in the same texture.
      You may want to modify the DepthBias in the technique pass to avoid Z-fighting
      artifacts when using this.
    default: 'true'
  examples:

    description: This example will replace the texture of a group of common explosions
      (grenades, rockets, etc) with a custom explosion effect

  - path: examples/engineApplyShaderToWorldTexture-2.lua
    description: This example will apply a shader to the "des_logwall" world texture
      (which is used by the house near the 'play' gamemode spawn point)
    side: client
  - path: examples/engineApplyShaderToWorldTexture-3.lua
    description: This example will apply a shader to the current vehicle of the local
      player

      examples on this page):'
    side: client

    values:
    - type: bool
      name: value
    description: Returns true if the shader was successfully applied, false otherwise.

  notes:
  - type: tip
    content: 'The resource shader_tex_names can help in finding the names of world
      textures. When replacing the texture for a ped using the CJ skin, set textureName
      to "CJ" The shader inherits the render states of the original when it is drawn,
      so texture stage 0 will already be set to the original texture. When using with
      a ''ped'', ensure you have set ''ped'' or ''all'' in the elementTypes when calling
      dxCreateShader CJ body parts textures can be replaced by using: "cj_ped_head",
      "cj_ped_hat", "cj_ped_torso", "cj_ped_legs", "cj_ped_feet", "cj_ped_glasses",
      "cj_ped_necklace", "cj_ped_watch" and "cj_ped_extra1". Latest version of shader_tex_names
      will show what is being used.'
