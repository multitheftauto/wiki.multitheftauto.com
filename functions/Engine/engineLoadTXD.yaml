  description: This function loads a RenderWare Texture Dictionary (TXD) file into
    GTA. The texture dictionary can then be used to provide textures.
  parameters: []
  examples: []
  notes:
  - type: info
    content: Follow loading order ( COL -> TXD -> DFF ) which is used in the example
      - as other orders can cause collisions, textures or the DFF not to load due
      to technical limitations.
  - type: tip
    content: Do your TXD files take megabytes of disk space? You can read some tips
      on reducing the size of TXD files to compress them without ruining texture quality.
  - type: info
    content: The filteringEnabled property overrides the filtering modes in each texture
      of the TXD with point filtering. It also sets the uAddressing and vAddressing
      to WRAP. If textures come with mipmaps then they are disabled which is especially
      visible without anisotropic filtering . It is recommended to set filteringEnabled
      to false if the TXD was created with mipmaps (the filtering mode can be changed
      in a TXD editor).
