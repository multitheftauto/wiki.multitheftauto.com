  description: This function loads a RenderWare Texture Dictionary (TXD) file into GTA. The texture dictionary can then be used to provide textures.
  parameters:
  - name: filePath/rawData
    type: string
    description: The [filepath](/reference/Filepath) to the TXD file you want to load or whole data buffer of the TXD file.
  - name: filteringEnabled
    type: bool
    description: Whether to enable texture filtering.
    default: 'true'
  examples: 
    - path: examples/engineLoadTXD-1.lua
    - path: examples/engineLoadTXD_OOP-1.lua
      oop: true
  returns:
    values:
    - type: txd|false
      name: txd element
    description: Returns a [TXD](/reference/txd) if the file was loaded, **false** otherwise.

  notes:
  - type: info
    content: |
      - Follow loading order **( COL -> TXD -> DFF )** as other orders can cause collisions, textures or the DFF not to load.
      - The **filteringEnabled** property overrides the filtering modes in each texture
        of the TXD with point filtering. It also sets the **uAddressing** and **vAddressing**
        to `WRAP`. If textures come with mipmaps then they are disabled which is especially
        visible without anisotropic filtering. It is recommended to set **filteringEnabled**
        to **false** if the TXD was created with mipmaps (the filtering mode can be changed
        in a TXD editor).

    content: Do your TXD files take megabytes of disk space? You can read some [tips
      on reducing the size of TXD files](/reference/Optimize_Custom_TXD) to compress them without ruining texture quality.
