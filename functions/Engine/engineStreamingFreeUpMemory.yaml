  notes:
  - type: info
    content: This function isn't accurate. The function works more like try to free
      up at least this amount of bytes . It usually ends up freeing everything that
      isn't currently needed (which, depending on the scenery might be 1-200 megabytes).
  - type: important
    content: This function is meant for advanced users only, as it can lead to stability
      issues . If you use it too often, the map might start to flicker.
