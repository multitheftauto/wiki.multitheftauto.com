  notes:
    - type: info
      content: This function has individual references counter for each resource. If you called **engineStreamingRequestModel** with increasing the counter twice, you should call [[engineStreamingReleaseModel]] twice to decrease the counter. MTA resets the counter after stopping a resource and calling [[engineFreeModel]].
