  name: engineReplaceAnimation
  description: This function replaces a specific internal (default) animation with
    a custom one that has been loaded using [engineLoadIFP](/wiki/EngineLoadIFP "EngineLoadIFP")
    function. This function only affects a specific [player](/wiki/Player "Player")
    or [ped](/wiki/Ped "Ped"), the [internal animation](/wiki/Animations "Animations")
    is not replaced for everyone, for instance, different players and peds are able
    to have completely different crouching, walking, and fighting etc., animations
    running simultaneously at the same time. Also, it's not synchronized, you'll need
    to execute this function on every client in Lua to synchronize it.

      animation.
