client:
  name: engineReplaceAnimation
  pair: engineRestoreAnimation
  description: This function replaces a specific internal (default) animation with
    a custom one that has been loaded using [[engineLoadIFP]]
    function. This function only affects a specific [[player]]
    or [[ped]], the [internal animation](/reference/ID_Lists/Animations)
    is not replaced for everyone, for instance, different players and peds are able
    to have completely different crouching, walking, and fighting etc., animations
    running simultaneously at the same time. Also, it's not synchronized, you'll need
    to execute this function on every client in Lua to synchronize it. Internal animations replaced using this function can still be played with [[setPedAnimation]]. You can restore replaced animations back with [[engineRestoreAnimation]].
  parameters:
  - name: thePed
    type: ped
    description: The player or ped you want to replace an animation for.
  - name: InternalBlockName
    type: string
    description: The [internal block](/reference/ID_Lists/Animations) name.
  - name: InternalAnimName
    type: string
    description: The [internal animation](/reference/ID_Lists/Animations) name inside **InternalBlockName**.
  - name: CustomBlockName
    type: string
    description: The custom block name of the loaded [IFP](/reference/ifp) file that you passed to [[engineLoadIFP]]
      as second parameter.
  - name: CustomAnimName
    type: string
    description: The custom animation name inside the loaded [IFP](/reference/ifp) file with **CustomBlockName**.
  examples:
  - path: examples/engineReplaceAnimation-1.lua
    description: This example loads a custom IFP file ([parkour.ifp](/downloads/parkour.ifp)), and replaces
      the internal crouch animation from ped block with a custom animation. If you
      press `C` on your keyboard, the custom animation will be played instead of crouch
      animation.
  returns:
    values:
    - type: bool
      name: result
    description: Returns **true** on success, **false** in case of failure.
  notes:
    - type: info
      content: Partial animations are not supported, you can still replace them, but they won't work as intended, for example, `FightA_block` animation from `ped` block is a partial animation, you can't replace it properly, only a few animations are partial, rest of them are not, so it shouldn't be a problem.
