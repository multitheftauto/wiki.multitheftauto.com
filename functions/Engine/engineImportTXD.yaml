  description: This function imports (adds) a loaded RenderWare Texture Dictionary
    into a specific model. This is necessary in order for the DFF loader to find any
    new textures. Please **call this function before loading the DFF model file**,
    in order to allow the DFF loading process to find the new textures. This function
    can also replace default GTA textures, so that it becomes possible to e.g. put
    custom images on existing billboards. Ped and weapon textures are also supported.

      to technical limitations.
