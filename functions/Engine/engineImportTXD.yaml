  name: engineImportTXD
  description: This function imports (adds) a loaded RenderWare Texture Dictionary
    into a specific model. This is necessary in order for the DFF loader to find any
    new textures. Please **call this function before loading the DFF model file**,
    in order to allow the DFF loading process to find the new textures. This function
    can also replace default GTA textures, so that it becomes possible to e.g. put
    custom images on existing billboards - ped and weapon textures are also supported.

    description: The TXD element that was loaded with [[engineLoadTXD]].

      - CJ clothing component textures can be replaced by using the IDs listed in the [clothes replacement](/reference/Clothes_replacement) article.
      - Follow loading order **( COL -> TXD -> DFF )** which is used in the example - as other orders can cause collisions, textures or the DFF not to load.

      on reducing the size of TXD files](/reference/Optimize_Custom_TXD) to compress them without ruining texture quality.
