  description: This function replaces the given model ID with the model contained
    in a DFF file loaded by [engineLoadDFF](/wiki/EngineLoadDFF "EngineLoadDFF").
    This function supports [vehicles](/wiki/Vehicle "Vehicle"), [objects](/wiki/Object
    "Object"), [peds](/wiki/Ped "Ped") and [players](/wiki/Player "Player").
  parameters: []
  examples:
  - path: examples/engineReplaceModel-1.lua
    description: This example allows you to replace single or many models (with ability
      to toggle TXD filtering/DFF alpha transparency) - by usingtable. Do not forget
      to add those file paths tometa.xml
    side: client
  notes:
  - type: info
    content: Follow loading order ( COL -> TXD -> DFF ) which is used in the example
      - as other orders can cause collisions, textures or the DFF not to load due
      to technical limitations. Default GTA map objects behave inconsistently when
      using this function on them. If you want to replace models in the original GTA
      map, you need to call engineRestreamWorld after replacing models as well. A
      raw data DFF element can only be used once, because the underlying memory for
      the model is released after replacement. If the replacement model is broken
      and the original model is not loaded/streamed-in at the time of replacement,
      this function will succeed and you won't see any error message, neither when
      the model replacement fails once the original model starts to load/stream-in.
