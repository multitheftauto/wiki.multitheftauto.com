  name: engineReplaceModel
  pair: engineRestoreModel
  description: This function replaces the given model with the model contained
    in a DFF file loaded by [[engineLoadDFF]].
  parameters:
  - name: theModel
    type: dff
    description: The model to replace the given model with.
  - name: modelNameOrID
    type: string/int
    description: The model ID or name of the model to be replaced.
  - name: alphaTransparency
    type: bool
    description: Set to **true** if model uses semi-transparent textures, e.g. windows.
      This will ensure other objects behind the semi-transparent textures are rendered
      correctly. **Can slightly impact performance, so only set when required**.
    default: 'false'
  examples:
  - path: examples/engineReplaceModel-1.lua
    description: This example allows you to replace single or many models (with ability
      to toggle TXD filtering/DFF alpha transparency) - by usingtable. Do not forget
      to add those file paths to `meta.xml`.
  - path: examples/engineReplaceModel_OOP-1.lua
    oop: true
  returns:
    values:
    - type: bool
      name: result
    description: Returns **true** if the model was successfully replaced, **false** if it
      failed for some reason, ie. the DFF or the model ID is not valid.

    element: dff
    method: replace

  notes:
  - type: info

      - Follow loading order **( COL -> TXD -> DFF )** which is used in the example - as other orders can cause collisions, textures or the DFF not to load.
      - Default GTA map objects behave inconsistently when
        using this function on them. If you want to replace models in the original GTA
        map, you need to call [[engineRestreamWorld]] after replacing models as well.
      - A raw data DFF element can only be used once, because the underlying memory for
        the model is released after replacement. 
      - If the replacement model is broken
        and the original model is not loaded/streamed-in at the time of replacement,
        this function will succeed and you won't see any error message, neither when
        the model replacement fails once the original model starts to load/stream-in.

      - If you want to replace CJ's clothing, check out [clothes replacement guide](/reference/Clothes_replacement).
      - To replace weapon models you must use their object IDs, not weapon IDs. There is a weapon model list available at [weapons list](/reference/ID_Lists/Weapons).
