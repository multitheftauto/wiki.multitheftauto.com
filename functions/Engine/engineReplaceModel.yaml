  description: This function replaces the given model ID with the model contained
    in a DFF file loaded by [engineLoadDFF](/wiki/EngineLoadDFF "EngineLoadDFF").
    This function supports [vehicles](/wiki/Vehicle "Vehicle"), [objects](/wiki/Object
    "Object"), [peds](/wiki/Ped "Ped") and [players](/wiki/Player "Player").
  parameters:
  - name: theModel
    type: dff
    description: The model to replace the given model ID with
  - name: modelID
    type: int
    description: The model it to replace the model of
  - name: alphaTransparency
    type: bool
    description: Set to true if model uses semi-transparent textures, e.g. windows.
      This will ensure other objects behind the semi-transparent textures are rendered
      correctly. (Can slightly impact performance, so only set when required)
    default: 'false'
  examples:
  - path: examples/engineReplaceModel-1.lua
    description: This example allows you to replace single or many models (with ability
      to toggle TXD filtering/DFF alpha transparency) - by usingtable. Do not forget
      to add those file paths tometa.xml

    values:
    - type: bool
      name: value
    description: Returns true if the model was successfully replaced, false if it
      failed for some reason, ie. the DFF or the model ID is not valid.

  notes:
  - type: info
    content: Follow loading order ( COL -> TXD -> DFF ) which is used in the example
      - as other orders can cause collisions, textures or the DFF not to load due
      to technical limitations. Default GTA map objects behave inconsistently when
      using this function on them. If you want to replace models in the original GTA
      map, you need to call engineRestreamWorld after replacing models as well. A
      raw data DFF element can only be used once, because the underlying memory for
      the model is released after replacement. If the replacement model is broken
      and the original model is not loaded/streamed-in at the time of replacement,
      this function will succeed and you won't see any error message, neither when
      the model replacement fails once the original model starts to load/stream-in.
