    description: 'Returns an integer of the model ID that was available to be assigned
      to the element type, false if no free model ID available or invalid element
      type.

      Do not rely on the model numbers returned being consistent across multiple clients
      or multiple runs of resources. There is no guarantee for the order of the numbers
      or that the same numbers will always correspond to the same element type. Any
      patterns are coincidental.'
  notes:
  - type: info
    content: Vehicle unique features may be unsupported, see issue 1861 for examples
      and details
  - type: tip
    content: 'For most cases, you will probably want to add models to your server
      that are synced with all clients automatically. This is possible with this resource
      : newmodels'
  - type: important
    content: Unlike some other functions, the side-effects of this function aren't
      reverted on resource stop, so you must manually call engineFreeModel in onClientResourceStop
      (Just like the example below does)
  - type: important
    content: parentID should be the same model type to prevent crashes.
