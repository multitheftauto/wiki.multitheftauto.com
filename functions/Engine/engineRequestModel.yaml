    description: 'This example creates a ped and then gives you the opportunity to

      - Vehicle unique features may be unsupported, see [issue 1861](https://github.com/multitheftauto/mtasa-blue/issues/1861) for examples and details.
      - Do not rely on the model numbers returned being consistent across multiple clients
        or multiple runs of resources. There is no guarantee for the order of the numbers
        or that the same numbers will always correspond to the same element type. Any
        patterns are coincidental.
  - type: tip
    content: 'For most cases, you will probably want to add models to your server
      that are synced with all clients automatically. This is possible with this resource: [newmodels](https://forum.multitheftauto.com/topic/133212-rel-add-new-models-library/).'
  - type: important
    content: |
      - Unlike some other functions, the side-effects of this function aren't
        reverted on resource stop, so you must manually call [[engineFreeModel]] in [[onClientResourceStop]].
      - **parentID** should be the same model type to prevent crashes.
