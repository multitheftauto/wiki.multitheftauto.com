  - type: info
    content: Vehicle unique features may be unsupported, see issue 1861 for examples
      and details

      that are synced with all clients automatically. This is possible with this resource
      : newmodels'
  - type: important
    content: Unlike some other functions, the side-effects of this function aren't
      reverted on resource stop, so you must manually call engineFreeModel in onClientResourceStop
      (Just like the example below does)
  - type: important
    content: parentID should be the same model type to prevent crashes.
