  notes:
  - type: info
    content: Follow loading order ( COL -> TXD -> DFF ) which is used in the example
      - as other orders can cause collisions, textures or the DFF not to load due
      to technical limitations. Collision libraries (.col files containing multiple
      collision models) are not supported. See COL for details. Object models are
      supported only (no vehicles or players).
