      Use/capfor creating the ped and/sapto skin the ped. You will need some skins

  notes:
  - type: info
    content: If there are elements created on the game world whose model ID does match
      the one that you want to release using the engineFreeModel function then their
      model ID is reset to a well-known default before releasing the internal model
      data. This is 0 for peds, 1337 for objects and 400 for vehicles. By doing this
      there are no model data leaks if using the engineFreeModel function while elements
      are still streamed-in. Creators of custom model systems have to be careful though
      as custom model IDs should only be released if all elements that use said ID
      are streamed-out or destroyed.
