    description: This example creates a ped and then gives you the opportunity to
      change its model. If the resource stops, then the IDs allocated will be deallocated.
      Use `/cap` for creating the ped and `/sap` to skin the ped. You will need some skins
      added to a folder and to the meta.xml for `/sap` to work.

    values:
    - type: bool
      name: result
    description: Returns **true** if the model was successfully freed, **false** otherwise.
  notes:
  - type: info
    content: If there are elements created on the game world whose model ID does match
      the one that you want to release using the **engineFreeModel** function then their
      model ID is reset to a well-known default before releasing the internal model
      data (parentID). By doing this
      there are no model data leaks if using the **engineFreeModel** function while elements
      are still streamed-in. Creators of custom model systems have to be careful though
      as custom model IDs should only be released if all elements that use said ID
      are streamed-out or destroyed.
