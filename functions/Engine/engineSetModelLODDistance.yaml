client:
  name: engineSetModelLODDistance
  pair: engineGetModelLODDistance
  description: This function sets a custom LOD distance for any object / model ID.
    This is the distance at which objects of that model ID are switched to their LOD
    model, or (if there is no LOD model) become invisible.
  parameters:
  - name: modelNameOrID
    type: string/int
    description: The model ID or name of the model you want to change the LOD distance of.
  - name: distance
    type: float
    description: New LOD distance value in San Andreas units.
  - name: extendedLod
    type: bool
    description: Allows to set a greater distance than the current 325 units.
    default: 'false'
  examples:
  - path: examples/engineSetModelLODDistance-1.lua
    description: This example will set the LOD distance of all script-created objects.
  - path: examples/engineSetModelLODDistance-2.lua
    description: This example will, besides replacing with custom map objects, also
      set the LOD distance accordingly, a necessary step (otherwise the object could
      seem to fail loading and only show up 1 feet away).
  - path: examples/engineSetModelLODDistance-3.lua
    description: This example shows how to use LOD's with buildings.

  notes:

        - This function only works with script-created objects, just like objects created with [[createObject]] or buildings created with [[createBuilding]]. It DOES NOT work with default map objects/buildings.
        - If the LOD distance for a high LOD model is set to more than 325, the fade out effect of the model will not trigger and the model will just pop in/pop out of existence.
        - The actual draw distance used is modified by the draw distance slider in the settings **Video** tab of the MTA client.
        - When the 'Video' tab draw distance slider is 0%, the **engineSetModelLODDistance** setting approximately matches the draw distance used. e.g  `engineSetModelLODDistance(1337,100)` will mean model 1337 will be visible up to a distance of **100** units.
        - When the **Video** tab draw distance slider is 100%, the **engineSetModelLODDistance** setting is approximately doubled before use. e.g. `engineSetModelLODDistance(1337,100)` will mean model 1337 will be visible up to a distance of **200** units.
        - There is a general draw distance limit of 325 units. So `engineSetModelLODDistance(1337,400)` will mean model 1337 will be visible up to a distance of 325 units no matter what the **Video** tab says.
        - The limit for [objects](/reference/object) is 325 units, but the actual draw distance used is 5 times the setting value. Also, they ignore the **Video** tab draw distance slider. So a setting of 200 will mean a low LOD element will always have a draw distance of 1000 units.
        - For [buildings](/reference/building) the distance must be set greater than 300 for a low LOD building in order to work correctly. Otherwise, the low LOD will always be visible. The actual draw distance is NOT 5 times the setting value.
        - You can use [[setVehiclesLODDistance]] for vehicles and [[setPedsLODDistance]] for peds.

        Therefore, unless it's really important, **engineSetModelLODDistance** should not be set to anything greater than 170.
        170 will still give the maximum draw distance (of 325 units) on clients that have a **Video** tab draw distance setting of 100%, and it will help reduce lag for players who chose a lower draw distance in their settings.
