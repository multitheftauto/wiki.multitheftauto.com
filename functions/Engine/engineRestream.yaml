  name: engineRestream
  description: This function re-streams a specific group of models and can be used as a more stable alternative to [[engineRestreamWorld]] when you only need to re-stream a specific model group rather than the entire world.
  parameters:
    - name: restreamOption
      type: string
      description: 'Which group of models should be re-streamed and can be one of the following: `world`, `vehicles`, `peds`, or `objects`.'
      default: '"world"'
  returns:
    description: This function always returns [[nil]].
    values:
      - type: nil
        name: nothing
  notes:
    - type: info
      content: This function works only on elements created by MTA. For example, objects created with [[createObject]]. If you want to re-stream elements that are part of the GTA map, you still need to use [[engineRestreamWorld]] or pass `world` as **restreamOption**.
    - type: tip
      content: If you only want to re-stream a specific model, [[engineRestreamModel]] may be a better choice.
