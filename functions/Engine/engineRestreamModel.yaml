  name: engineRestreamModel
  description: This function re-streams a specific model by its ID. It can be used as a more efficient alternative to [[engineRestreamWorld]] when you only need to re-stream a single model. For example, after using [[engineImageLinkDFF]], instead of calling [[engineRestreamWorld]], you can call [[engineRestreamModel]] to re-stream only the replaced model, improving performance.
  parameters:
    - name: modelId
      type: int
      description: The ID of the model you want to re-stream.
  examples:
    - path: examples/engineRestreamModel-1.lua
  returns:
    description: The function returns **true** if the model was successfully re-streamed, and **false** otherwise.
    values:
      - type: bool
        name: result
  notes:
    - type: info
      content: This function works only on elements created by MTA. For example, objects created with [[createObject]]. If you want to re-stream elements that are part of the GTA map, you still need to use [[engineRestreamWorld]].
