client:
  name: engineSetAsynchronousLoading
  description: |
    This function enables or disables asynchronous model loading. Enabling
    asynchronous model loading may reduce the small pauses that occur when a new model
    is displayed for the first time. However, it can cause the new models to appear
    slightly later than they might have otherwise.

    If asynchronous loading is disabled, MTA requests all resources to be loaded at the time they have been requested. This will halt game execution for the time being.
    Otherwise, all resource requests are queued up on the to-be-loaded queue. At the beginning of the game frame, the GTA:SA streaming system is updated, along with its streaming slicers. This is when a model is loaded after going through multiple stages. Having asynchronous loading disabled forces all stages to be consecutively run through.

    For more details read [GTA:SA Resource Streaming](/reference/GTA_Resource_Streaming).

  notes:
  - type: warning
    content: Using this function with a large amounts of **engineReplace*** at the same
      time may cause loading times to be exponentially slower.
