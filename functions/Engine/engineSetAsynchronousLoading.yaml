  description: This function enables or disables asynchronous model loading. Enabling
    asynchronous model loading may reduce the small pauses that occur when a new model
    is displayed for the first time. However, it can cause the new models to appear
    slightly later than they might have otherwise.
  parameters: []
  examples:
  - path: examples/engineSetAsynchronousLoading-1.lua
    description: The next example enables the model asynchronous loading ignoring
      client preferences if there are a lot of objects (and the player wants to).

  notes:
  - type: warning
    content: Using this function with a large amounts of engineReplace* at the same
      time may cause loading times to be exponentially slower.
