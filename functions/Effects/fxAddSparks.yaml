  name: fxAddSparks
  description: Creates a number of sparks originating from a point or along a line.
  parameters:
  - name: posX
    type: float
    description: The world X coordinate where the effect originates.
  - name: posY
    type: float
    description: The world Y coordinate where the effect originates.
  - name: posZ
    type: float
    description: The world Z coordinate where the effect originates.
  - name: dirX
    type: float
    description: The direction X coordinate of the effect. The longer the distance from position is, the faster sparks fly.
  - name: dirY
    type: float
    description: The direction Y coordinate of the effect. The longer the distance from position is, the faster sparks fly.
  - name: dirZ
    type: float
    description: The direction Z coordinate of the effect. The longer the distance from position is, the faster sparks fly.
  - name: force
    type: float
    description: The higher this value, the faster and further the
      sparks fly.
    default: '1.0'
  - name: count
    type: int
    description: The number of effects to create.
    default: '1'
  - name: acrossLineX
    type: float
    description: If specified, the sparks will be created along a line going from pos to pos - acrossLine. If not specified, all sparks originate from the point at pos.
    default: '0.0'
  - name: acrossLineY
    type: float
    description: If specified, the sparks will be created along a line going from pos to pos - acrossLine. If not specified, all sparks originate from the point at pos.
    default: '0.0'
  - name: acrossLineZ
    type: float
    description: If specified, the sparks will be created along a line going from pos to pos - acrossLine. If not specified, all sparks originate from the point at pos.
    default: '0.0'
  - name: blur
    type: bool
    description: if false, creates standard bullet impact-like sparks. If true,
      adds motion blur to the sparks.
    default: 'false'
  - name: spread
    type: float
    description: determines how strongly the particles deviate from each other. With
      low values the particles will stay quite close together, high values will make
      them fly in all directions. Also affects their speed.
    default: '1.0'
  - name: life
    type: float
    description: the higher this value, the longer the sparks survive before they
      disappear.
    default: '1.0'
