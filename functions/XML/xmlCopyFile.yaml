    element: xmlnode
    method: copy
  description: |
    This function copies all contents of a certain node in a XML document to a new document file, so the copied node becomes the new file's root node. The new file will not be saved to file system until [xmlSaveFile](/xmlSaveFile) is called.
  parameters:
    - name: 'nodeToCopy'
      type: 'xmlnode'

    - name: 'newFilePath'
      type: 'string'

        the path of the file that is to be created, in the following format: `":resourceName/path"`. `'resourceName'` is the name of the resource the file is in, and `'path'` is the path from the root directory of the resource to the file.
        If the file is to be in the current resource, only the file path is necessary, e.g. `"newfile.xml"`.
        For example, to create a file named `'newfile.xml'` with myNode as the root node in the resource `'ctf'`, it can be done from another resource this way: `xmlCopyFile(myNode, ":ctf/newfile.xml")`.
        If the file is to be in the current resource, only the file path is necessary, e.g. `xmlCopyFile(myNode, "newfile.xml")`.
  returns:
