  description: |
    This function provides an alternative way to load XML files to [getResourceConfig](/getResourceConfig). This function loads an XML file and returns the node by specifying a specific file path, while [getResourceConfig](/getResourceConfig) allows for loading an XML file from a resource.
  parameters:
    - name: 'filePath'
      type: 'string'
      description: |
        The [Filepath](/reference/Filepath) of the file in the following format: **":resourceName/path"**. *resourceName* is the name of the resource the file will be in, and *path* is the path from the root directory of the resource to the file. For example, if you want to create a file named *new.xml* in the resource *ctf*, it can be created from another resource this way [xmlCreateFile](/xmlCreateFile)(":ctf/new.xml", "newroot"). If the file is in the current resource, only the file path is necessary, e.g. [xmlCreateFile](/xmlCreateFile)("new.xml", "newroot"). Note that if a different resource than default is being accessed, the caller resource needs access to **general.ModifyOtherObjects** in the [ACL](/ACL).
    - name: 'readOnly'
      type: 'boolean'
      default: 'false'
      description: By default, the XML file is opened with reading and writing access. You can specify true for this parameter if you only need reading access.
