    description: This shows an example of a clientside XML file. You can use this
      to store user preferences and load them the next time the script loads. Almost
      always, you should have an options GUI for clients to interact with to set these
      values.Since the XML will change, it should NOT be included in the resource's
      meta.xml file. MTA will think that file is corrupted and will download it again
      from the server. Instead, you should create the XML within the script, and then
      load it within the script on future script runs if it exists.
