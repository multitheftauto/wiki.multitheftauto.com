  description: This function will attach a scripting function (handler) to a console
    command, so that whenever a player or administrator uses the command the function
    is called.
  parameters: []
  examples:
  - path: examples/addCommandHandler-1.lua
    description: Example 1:This example defines a command handler for the commandcreatemarker.
      This will create a red marker at the position of the player player who uses
      it.

  - path: examples/addCommandHandler-2.lua
    description: Example 2:This example makes use of Lua's vararg expression to implement
      acheck_parameterscommand to count the number of parameters passed, merge them
      all into a single string and output it. This is also shows you how you can use
      table.concat to merge all the passed arguments. This is particularly useful
      when you want to read in a sentence of text passed from the user.
    side: server
  - path: examples/addCommandHandler-3.lua
    description: Example 3:This example shows using a single function to handle multiple
      command handlers. This isn't advised for general usage, as it makes code harder
      to understand, but where multiple command handlers share some logic, it can
      be a useful way of reducing duplicated code. Generally, it would be preferable
      to put this shared logic in a separate function instead, as this gives you more
      control over the flow.
    side: server
  - path: examples/addCommandHandler-4.lua
    description: Example 1:This example warps the local player to a random nearby
      location (useful for when a player gets stuck somewhere).
    side: client
  notes:
  - type: info
    content: You can't use "check", "list", "test" and "help" as a command name.
  - type: important
    content: Do NOT use the same name for your handler function as the command name,
      as this can lead to confusion if multiple handler functions are used. Use a
      name that describes your handler's purpose more specifically.
