    description: 'The visual type of the marker to be created. Possible values: "checkpoint"
      : A race checkpoint. These are very tall, but not infinite, light pillars. Checkpoints
      snap to ground and become invisible after going over a certain Z height. "ring"
      : Doughnut shaped ring, normally used for aircraft. "cylinder" : Small glowing
      ground ring. These are the glow markers you walk into to activate missions or
      events in single player. "arrow" : Arrow pointing down. These are the arrows
      on the doors you can enter in single player, except MTA''s are not animated
      by default. "corona" : A glowing ball of light.'
    default: '"checkpoint"'

      of the marker (0 - 255).
    default: '255'
  - name: a
    type: int
    description: An integer number representing the amount of alpha to use in the
      colouring of the marker (0 - 255 where 0 is transparent and 255 is opaque).

  - type: warning
    content: When using type "arrow" markers, you may experience positioning issues.
      This is a known issue with how GTA creates these types of markers. It is recommended
      you keep the position at least 1 game unit above the ground to avoid issues.
  - type: warning
    content: '"cylinder" marker type doesn''t have the same size for collisions and
      visible textures. Note that the marker collisions are around 10-20% bigger than
      the visible texture.'
