  notes:
  - type: warning
    content: When using type "arrow" markers, you may experience positioning issues.
      This is a known issue with how GTA creates these types of markers. It is recommended
      you keep the position at least 1 game unit above the ground to avoid issues.
  - type: warning
    content: '"cylinder" marker type doesn''t have the same size for collisions and
      visible textures. Note that the marker collisions are around 10-20% bigger than
      the visible texture.'
