  description: This function changes a marker's type. The type controls how the marker
    is displayed in the game. It's important that you use marker types that users
    are used to from the single player game. For example, checkpoints are used in
    races, rings are used for aircraft races, arrows are used for entering buildings
    etc.

  - name: theMarker
    type: marker

    type: string
    description: 'A string denoting the marker type. Valid values are: "checkpoint"
      : A race checkpoint. These are very tall, but not infinite, light pillars. Checkpoints
      snap to ground and become invisible after going over a certain Z height. "ring"
      : Doughnut shaped ring, normally used for aircraft. "cylinder" : Small glowing
      ground ring. These are the glow markers you walk into to activate missions or
      events in single player. "arrow" : Arrow pointing down. These are the arrows
      on the doors you can enter in single player, except MTA''s are not animated
      by default. "corona" : A glowing ball of light.'
