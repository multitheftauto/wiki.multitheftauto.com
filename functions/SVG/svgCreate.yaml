  notes:
  - type: info
    content: SVG in MTA is handled by the lunasvg rendering engine - Some features
      in MTA may not work properly, compared to the browser.
  - type: tip
    content: If you are experiencing poor texture quality or artifacts in the form
      of black outlines, setting the blend mode to add might help
  - type: important
    content: Before r21155 ( 3157905 ) the provided callback was only fired once after
      the function had performed its task. This is no longer the case - each SVG can
      now store a single callback function (optional) which is fired every time the
      SVG texture has been changed/updated.
