  notes:
  - type: important
    content: Before r21155 ( 3157905 ) the provided callback wasn't stored on the
      SVG and was only fired once after the function had performed its task. This
      is no longer the case - each SVG can now store a single callback function (optional)
      which is fired every time the SVG texture has been changed/updated.
