  parameters:
  - name: pixels/filepath
    type: string
    description: '[Pixels](/reference/Pixels/) containing image data. (`plain`, `jpeg` or `png` pixels can be used here). Or The [filepath](/reference/Filepath) of the image. **(.bmp, .dds, .jpg, .png, and .tga images are supported) - for .svg use [[svgCreate]]**. Image files should ideally have dimensions that are a power of two, to prevent possible blurring.'

  notes:
  - type: tip
    content: |
      - It is recommended to pre-convert textures to whatever format you want
      to load them as. ARGB should be PNG, all other formats are self explanatory.
      By doing this you can load textures on the fly without any hickups (Note: There
      might still be some if the user has a slow HHD). See [DirectXTex texconv tool](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex/releases).
      - For vector textures (.svg) use [[svgCreate]].
      - It is highly recommended that [[dxSetTestMode]] is used when writing and testing scripts using **dxCreateTexture**.
      - You should always check to see if this function has returned **false**.
  - type: important
    content: This function uses significant process RAM, make sure you don't load
      a lot of textures, because you'll run out of memory and crash MTA on your gaming
      PC beyond the technical limit of 3.5-4 GB (weak PC users much earlier). Besides
      that, don't make the common mistake of causing a memory leak by not destroying
      textures (causing dxTextures to pile up) when they should no longer display
      per your script, which causes FPS lag and crashes all over MTA due to so many
      scripters missing it.
