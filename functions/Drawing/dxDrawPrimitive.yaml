  name: dxDrawPrimitive
  description: This function draws a 2D primitive shape across the screen - rendered for **one** frame. This should be used in conjunction with [[onClientRender]] in order to display continuously.
  parameters:
  - name: pType
    type: string
    description: Type of primitive to be drawn.
    templateList: primitives
  - name: postGUI
    type: bool
    description: A bool representing whether the line should be drawn on top of or
      behind any ingame GUI (rendered by CEGUI).
  - name: vertex1
    type: table
    description: |
      Tables representing each primitive vertex, required amount of them is determined by primitive type. See vertices format below:

      - **posX** - An [[float]] representing the absolute X position of the vertex, represented by pixels on the screen.
      - **posY** - An [[float]] representing the absolute Y position of the vertex, represented by pixels on the screen.
      - **color (optional)** - An [integer](/reference/int) of the hex color, produced using [[tocolor]] or 0xAARRGGBB (AA = alpha, RR = red, GG = green, BB = blue). If it's not specified, white color is used.

  examples:
  - path: examples/dxDrawPrimitive-1.lua
    description: This is a small example that creates trianglefan primitive with vertices in places that user clicks. It assigns every vertex random color.
  - path: examples/dxDrawPrimitive-2.lua
    description: This example draws one complete oscillation of a sine wave starting in the center of the players screen using a linestrip type primitive.
  - path: examples/dxDrawPrimitive-3.lua
    description: Modifying the previous example, we can also use it to draw a "loading
      circle"-symbol similar to what some modern games like using to indicate loading
      or cloud saving in progress.

    values:
