client:
  name: dxDrawImage
  description: |
    Draws an image on the screen for a **single** frame. In order for the image to stay visible continuously, you need to call this function with the same parameters on each frame update (see [[onClientRender]]).
    Image files should ideally have dimensions that are a power of two, to prevent possible blurring.
    **Power of two: 2px, 4px, 8px, 16px, 32px, 64px, 128px, 256px, 512px, 1024px...**
  parameters:
  - name: posX
    type: float
    description: The absolute X coordinate of the top left corner of the image.
  - name: posY
    type: float
    description: The absolute Y coordinate of the top left corner of the image.
  - name: width
    type: float
    description: The absolute width of the examples/dxDrawImageSection-1.lua
  - name: height
    type: float
    description: The absolute height of the image.
  - name: image
    type: string/texture
    description: Either a [[texture]] element or a [filepath](/reference/Filepath) of the image which is going
      to be drawn. Image files should ideally have dimensions that are a power of two, to prevent possible blurring. Use a texture
      created with [[dxCreateTexture]] to **speed up drawing**.
  - name: rotation
    type: 'float'
    description: The rotation, in degrees for the image.
    default: '0'
  - name: rotationCenterOffsetX
    type: float
    description: The absolute X offset from the image center for which to rotate the image from.
    default: '0'
  - name: rotationCenterOffsetY
    type: float
    description: The absolute Y offset from the image center for which to rotate the image from.
    default: '0'
  - name: color
    type: int
    description: Tints the image with a value produced by [[tocolor]] or hexadecimal number in format 0xAARRGGBB (RR = red, GG = green, BB = blue, AA = alpha).
    default: tocolor(255,255,255,255)
  - name: postGUI
    type: boolean
    description: A [[bool]] representing whether the image should be drawn on top of or behind any ingame GUI (rendered by CEGUI).
    default: 'false'
  examples:
  - path: examples/dxDrawImage-1.lua
    description: Example of a pendulum swinging from the top of the screen, made using **dxDrawImage**.
  returns:
    values:
    - type: bool
      name: result
    description: Returns **true** if successful, **false** otherwise.
  preview_images:
    - path: 'dxDrawImage.png'
      description: An image drawn on the screen with the **dxDrawImage** function.
  notes:

      - Do not draw image from path. Use a texture created with [[dxCreateTexture]] instead to efficiently draw image.
      - For further optimising your DX code, see [[dxCreateRenderTarget]]. You should use render target whenever possible, in order to dramatically reduce CPU usage caused by many **dxDraw*** calls.
      - To help prevent edge artifacts when drawing textures, set **textureEdge** to `clamp` when calling [[dxCreateTexture]].
