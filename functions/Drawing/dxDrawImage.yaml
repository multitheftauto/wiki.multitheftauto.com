  description: "Draws an image on the screen for a single frame. In order for the\
    \ image to stay visible continuously, you need to call this function with the\
    \ same parameters on each frame update (see [onClientRender](/wiki/OnClientRender\
    \ \"OnClientRender\")).  \n\nImage files should ideally have dimensions that are\
    \ a power of two, to prevent possible blurring.  \n\n**Power of two: 2px, 4px,\
    \ 8px, 16px, 32px, 64px, 128px, 256px, 512px, 1024px...**"
  parameters:
  - name: posX
    type: float
    description: the absolute X coordinate of the top left corner of the image
  - name: posY
    type: float
    description: the absolute Y coordinate of the top left corner of the image
  - name: width
    type: float
    description: the absolute width of the image
  - name: height
    type: float
    description: the absolute height of the image
  - name: image
    type: mixed
    description: Either a material element or a filepath of the image which is going
      to be drawn. (.dds images are also supported). Image files should ideally have
      dimensions that are a power of two, to prevent possible blurring. Use a texture
      created with dxCreateTexture to speed up drawing .

  notes:
  - type: tip
    content: To help prevent edge artifacts when drawing textures, set textureEdge
      to "clamp" when calling dxCreateTexture .
  - type: important
    content: Do not draw image from path. Use a texture created with dxCreateTexture
      instead to efficiently draw image .
  - type: important
    content: For further optimising your DX code, see dxCreateRenderTarget . You should
      use render target whenever possible, in order to dramatically reduce CPU usage
      caused by many dxDraw* calls.
