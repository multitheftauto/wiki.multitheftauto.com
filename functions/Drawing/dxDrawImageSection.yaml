  description: Differing from [dxDrawImage](/wiki/DxDrawImage "DxDrawImage"), this
    function only draws a part of an image on the screen for a single frame. In order
    for the image to stay visible continuously, you need to call this function with
    the same parameters on each frame update (see [onClientRender](/wiki/OnClientRender
    "OnClientRender")).
  parameters:
  - name: posX
    type: float
    description: the absolute X coordinate of the top left corner of the image
  - name: posY
    type: float
    description: the absolute Y coordinate of the top left corner of the image
  - name: width
    type: float
    description: the absolute width of the image
  - name: height
    type: float
    description: the absolute height of the image
  - name: u
    type: float
    description: the absolute X coordinate of the top left corner of the section which
      should be drawn from image
  - name: v
    type: float
    description: the absolute Y coordinate of the top left corner of the section which
      should be drawn from image
  - name: usize
    type: float
    description: the absolute width of the image section
  - name: vsize
    type: float
    description: the absolute height of the image section
  - name: image
    type: mixed
    description: Either a material element or a filepath of the image which is going
      to be drawn. (.dds images are also supported). Image files should ideally have
      dimensions that are a power of two, to prevent possible blurring. Use a texture
      created with dxCreateTexture to speed up drawing .
  - name: rotation
    type: float
    description: the rotation, in degrees for the image.
    default: '0'
  - name: rotationCenterOffsetX
    type: float
    description: the absolute X offset from the image center for which to rotate the
      image from.
    default: '0'
  - name: rotationCenterOffsetY
    type: float
    description: the absolute Y offset from the image center for which to rotate the
      image from.
    default: '0'
  - name: color
    type: int
    description: 'the color of the image, a value produced by tocolor or hexadecimal
      number in format: 0xAARRGGBB (AA = alpha, RR = red, GG = green, BB = blue).'
    default: white
  - name: postGUI
    type: bool
    description: MISSING_PARAM_DESC
    default: 'false'

      to test.)

    description: Returns true if successful, false otherwise.
  notes:
  - type: tip
    content: Use a texture created with dxCreateTexture to speed up drawing .
  - type: tip
    content: To help prevent edge artifacts when drawing textures, set textureEdge
      to "clamp" when calling dxCreateTexture
