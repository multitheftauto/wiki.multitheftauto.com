  name: dxDrawPrimitive3D
  description: This function draws a 3D primitive in the 3D world - rendered for **one** frame. This should be used in conjunction with [[onClientRender]]/[[onClientPreRender]] in order to display continuously.
  parameters:
  - name: pType
    type: string
    description: Type of primitive to be drawn.
    templateList: primitives
  - name: stage
    type: string
    description: A string representing a stage at which the actual drawcall should happen.
    templateList: primitive-drawing-stages
  - name: vertex1
    type: table
    description: |
      Tables representing each primitive vertex, required amount of them is determined by primitive type. See vertices format below:

      - **posX** - An [[float]] representing the X position of the vertex in the GTA world.
      - **posY** - An [[float]] representing the Y position of the vertex in the GTA world.
      - **posZ** - An [[float]] representing the Z position of the vertex in the GTA world.
      - **color (optional)** - An [integer](/reference/int) of the hex color, produced using [[tocolor]] or 0xAARRGGBB (AA = alpha, RR = red, GG = green, BB = blue). If it's not specified, white color is used.
