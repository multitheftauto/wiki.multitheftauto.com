  name: dxDrawWiredSphere
  description: This function drawn same sphere as `/showcol`. It provides 4 levels of
    iterations which mean density of sphere.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    type: float
    description: X position in world of sphere.
  - name: "y"
    type: float
    description: Y position in world of sphere.
  - name: z
    type: float
    description: Z position in world of sphere.
  - name: radius
    type: float
    description: A radius of sphere.
  - name: theColor
    type: int
    description: A color of sphere from [[tocolor]] function or in the AARRGGBB format.
  - name: fLineWidth
    type: float
    description: A width of line.
  - name: iterations
    type: uint
    description: Number 1, 2, 3 or 4. 1 mean low density, 4 mean high.

  notes:
    - type: important 
      content: Adjust radius to iterations to get optimum density of mesh. About 50 spheres with iterations \= 4 can cause fps drop.
