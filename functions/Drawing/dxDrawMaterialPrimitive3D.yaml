    If image file is used, it should ideally have dimensions that are a power of two,
    to prevent possible blurring.

    description: This example draws the picture with the file name 'test.png' on the
      ground of Grove Street and adds a /flip command to flip it. The 'test.png' file
      needs to be included in themeta.xmlin order for this example to work.

  notes:
  - type: info
    content: When a 3D draw call is issued by any such material MTA function then
      the principle to push it directly to the 3D adapter does apply. To achieve this
      there is no software-side 3D clipping mathematics being performed. This way
      the vertex data is always being pushed to the vertex shader, leaving the entire
      freedom to the developer on how to interpret this vertex data in the shader.
      For example, even though this function does imply an use in 3D world space,
      the vertex coordinates could be translated directly into Direct3D 9 screen space
      instead, effectively discarding any multiplication with the camera projection
      matrix. The mathematical model for translation into valid Direct3D 9 screen-space
      coordinates is described here . Let's assume that you are drawing the rectangle
      on a classic sheet of paper with a mathematical 2D X,Y coordinate system.
  - type: info
    content: To transform the coordinates you first have to flip the Y coordinate
      using negation and then apply the Direct3D 9 screen-space rasterization cross-hair
      by using the screen dimensions (sw, sh). Since linear shapes are being preserved
      across linear translations, you can simplify each vertex-based figure into it's
      set of vertices for the purpose shown above. By using this function in such
      a way it can perform all the operations in the same quality such as the simpler
      dxDrawMaterialPrimitive function.
