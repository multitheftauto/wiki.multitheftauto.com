  description: This function sets the current blend mode for the dxDraw functions.
    Changing the blend mode can increase the quality when drawing text or certain
    other images to a render target. As a general guide use **modulate\_add** when
    drawing text to a render target, and **add** when drawing the render target to
    the screen. Don't forget to restore the default **blend** at the end \- See the
    example below.
