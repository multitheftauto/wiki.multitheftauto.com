  description: 'This function allows for the positioning of dxDraw calls to be automatically
    adjusted according to the client''s aspect ratio setting. This lasts for a single
    execution of an event handler for one of the following events: [onClientRender](/wiki/OnClientRender
    "OnClientRender"), [onClientPreRender](/wiki/OnClientPreRender "OnClientPreRender")
    and [onClientHUDRender](/wiki/OnClientHUDRender "OnClientHUDRender"). So the function
    has to be called every frame, just like dxDraws.'
