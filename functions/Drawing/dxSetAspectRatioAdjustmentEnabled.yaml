client:
  name: dxSetAspectRatioAdjustmentEnabled
  pair: dxIsAspectRatioAdjustmentEnabled
  description: |
      This function allows for the positioning of dxDraw calls to be automatically adjusted according to the client's aspect ratio setting. This lasts for a single execution of an event handler for one of the following events: [[onClientRender]], [[onClientPreRender]] and [[onClientHUDRender]]. So the function has to be called every frame, just like dxDraws.

      This is particularly useful for draws that must align with the GTA HUD, for which the sizing and positioning can vary for different aspect ratios.
  parameters:
  - name: bEnabled
    type: bool
    description: Should the adjustment be enabled or disabled.
  - name: sourceRatio
    type: float
    description: This should be set to the aspect ratio the dxDraws were originally designed in.
    default: 4/3
