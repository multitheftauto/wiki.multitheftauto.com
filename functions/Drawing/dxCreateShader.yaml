  description: This function creates a [shader](/wiki/Shader "Shader") element that
    can be used in the dxDraw functions. Successful shader creation is not guaranteed
    unless the [Effect File](/wiki/Shader "Shader") contains a fallback technique
    which will work on every existing PC.
  parameters:
  - name: filepath / string raw_data
    type: string
    description: MISSING_PARAM_DESC
  - name: priority
    type: float
    description: If more than one shader is matched to a world texture, the shader
      with the highest priority will be used. If there is more than one shader with
      the same highest priority, the most recently created shader is used.
    default: '0'
  - name: maxDistance
    type: float
    description: If non-zero, the shader will be applied to textures nearer than maxDistance
      only. This can speed up rendering, but (to look good) may require the shader
      to fade out it's own effect as the texture reaches maxDistance.
    default: '0'
  - name: layered
    type: bool
    description: When set to true, the shader will be drawn in a separate render pass.
      Several layered shaders can be drawn on the same world texture. (To avoid Z
      fighting artifacts, you may have to add DepthBias=-0.0002; to the technique
      pass, but this might cause visual artifacts when applied on vehicles)
    default: 'false'
  - name: elementTypes
    type: string
    description: 'A comma seperated list of element types to restrict this shader
      to. Valid element types are: world - Textures in the GTA world ped - Player
      and ped textures vehicle - Vehicles textures object - Objects textures other
      - Element textures which are not peds, vehicles or objects all - Everything'
    default: '"world'
  - name: ped
