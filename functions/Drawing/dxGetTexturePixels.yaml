  notes:
  - type: info
    content: This function is slow and not something you want to be doing once a frame.
      It is slower when reading pixels from a render target or screen source. And
      is very slow indeed if the texture format is not 'argb' (unless the native '
      dds' format is used with correct options).
  - type: important
    content: If the user has not enabled screen uploading in the settings, the function
      will use a 32x32 empty texture as a basis.
