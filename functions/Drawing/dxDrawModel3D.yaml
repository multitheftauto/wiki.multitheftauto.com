  description: This function draws a 3D model \- rendered for **one** frame. Drawn
    models are indistinguishable from this one created by [createObject](/wiki/CreateObject
    "CreateObject") function. This should be used in conjunction with [onClientRender](/wiki/OnClientRender
    "OnClientRender") or [onClientPreRender](/wiki/OnClientPreRender "OnClientPreRender")
    in order to display continuously. Note that a model must be loaded at the time
    this function is called. A model can be loaded and unloaded with the help of [engineStreamingRequestModel](/wiki/EngineStreamingRequestModel
    "EngineStreamingRequestModel") and [engineStreamingReleaseModel](/wiki/EngineStreamingReleaseModel
    "EngineStreamingReleaseModel") functions.
