client:
  name: dxDrawMaterialPrimitive
  description: |
    This function draws a 2D primitive shape with material applied to it across the screen - rendered for **one** frame. This should be used in conjunction with [[onClientRender]] in order to display continuously.
    
    If image file is used, it should ideally have dimensions that are a power of two, to prevent possible blurring. 
    **Power of two: 2px, 4px, 8px, 16px, 32px, 64px, 128px, 256px, 512px, 1024px...**
  parameters:
  - name: pType
    type: string
    description: Type of primitive to be drawn. More info on [MSDN site](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb147291(v=vs.85).aspx).
    templateList: primitives
  - name: material
    type: string/texture
    description: Either a [[texture]] element or a [filepath](/reference/Filepath) of the image which is going to be drawn. Image files should ideally have dimensions that are a power of two, to prevent possible blurring. Use a texture created with [[dxCreateTexture]] to **speed up drawing**.

    type: table
    description: |
      Tables representing each primitive vertex, required amount of them is determined by primitive type. See vertices format below:

      - **posX** - An [[float]] representing the absolute X position of the vertex, represented by pixels on the screen.
      - **posY** - An [[float]] representing the absolute Y position of the vertex, represented by pixels on the screen.
      - **color (optional)** - An [integer](/reference/int) of the hex color, produced using [[tocolor]] or 0xAARRGGBB (AA = alpha, RR = red, GG = green, BB = blue). If it's not specified, white color is used.
      - **u** - An [[float]] representing the relative X coordinate of the top left corner of the material which should be drawn from image.
      - **v** - An [[float]] representing the relative Y coordinate of the top left corner of the material which should be drawn from image.
