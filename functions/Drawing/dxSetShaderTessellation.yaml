  name: dxSetShaderTessellation
  description: This function sets the amount of geometric sub-division to use when drawing a [[shader]] element with [[dxDrawImage]]. Using tessellation allows a shader to manipulate the shape of the rendered image at each sub-division boundary.
  parameters:
  - name: theShader
    type: shader
    description: The [[shader]] element whose tessellation is to be changed.
  - name: tessellationX
    type: int
    description: The number of sub-division points along the X axis. Range is 1 to 500.
  - name: tessellationY
    type: int
    description: The number of sub-division points along the Y axis. Range is 1 to 500.

    values:
    - type: bool
      name: result
    description: Returns **true** if the shader element's tessellation was successfully
      changed, **false** otherwise.
