  name: dxDrawMaterialSectionLine3D
  description: This function draws a textured 3D line between two points in the 3D world - rendered for **one** frame. This should be used in conjunction with [[onClientRender]]/[[onClientPreRender]] in order to display continuously.
  parameters:
  - name: startX
    type: float
    description: The start X position of the 3D line, representing a coordinate in the GTA world.
  - name: startY
    type: float
    description: The start Y position of the 3D line, representing a coordinate in the GTA world.
  - name: startZ
    type: float
    description: The start Z position of the 3D line, representing a coordinate in the GTA world.
  - name: endX
    type: float
    description: The end X position of the 3D line, representing a coordinate in the GTA world.
  - name: endY
    type: float
    description: The end Y position of the 3D line, representing a coordinate in the GTA world.
  - name: endZ
    type: float
    description: The end Z position of the 3D line, representing a coordinate in the GTA world.
  - name: u
    type: float
    description: The absolute X coordinate of the top left corner of the section.
  - name: v
    type: float
    description: The absolute Y coordinate of the top left corner of the section.
  - name: usize
    type: float
    description: The absolute width of the section.
  - name: vsize
    type: float
    description: The absolute height of the section.
  - name: flipUV
    type: bool
    description: A bool representing whether a UV orientation should be flipped.
    default: 'false'
  - name: material
    type: texture
    description: A [[texture]] to draw the line with.
  - name: width
    type: float
    description: The width/thickness of the line in GTA world units. (This is 1/75th
      of the width used in [[dxDrawLine3D]]).
  - name: color
    type: int
    description: An integer of the hex color, produced using [[tocolor]] or 0xAARRGGBB.
    default: tocolor(255,255,255,255)
  - name: stage
    type: string
    description: A string representing a stage at which the actual drawcall should happen.
    default: '"postfx"'
    templateList: line-drawing-stages
  - name: faceTowardX
    type: float
    description: The X position the front of the line should face towards. If this is not set, the camera position is used, so the front of the line faces toward the camera.
    default: nil
  - name: faceTowardY
    type: float
    description: The Y position the front of the line should face towards. If this is not set, the camera position is used, so the front of the line faces toward the camera.
    default: nil
  - name: faceTowardZ
    type: float
    description: The Z position the front of the line should face towards. If this is not set, the camera position is used, so the front of the line faces toward the camera.
    default: nil
  examples:
  - path: examples/dxDrawMaterialSectionLine3D-1.lua
    description: This example draws corona like effects near the player.

    values:
    - type: bool
      name: result
    description: Returns a **true** if the operation was successful, **false** otherwise.
  notes:
    - type: tip
      content: |
        - The 3D line with a large width value effectively becomes a rectangle, so it it possible to construct basic shapes such as boxes with several large width lines and the appropriate values for 'faceToward'.
        - 3D lines are drawn at a particular place in the [game processing order](/reference/game_processing_order), so use [[onClientPreRender]] for drawing if you are attaching them to world elements.
