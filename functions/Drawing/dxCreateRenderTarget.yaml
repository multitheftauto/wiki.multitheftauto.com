  name: dxCreateRenderTarget
  description: This function creates a render target element, which is a special type
    of [[texture]] that can be drawn on with the dx functions.
    Successful render target creation is not guaranteed, and may fail due to hardware
    or memory limitations.
  parameters:
  - name: width
    type: int
    description: The width of the texture in pixels.
  - name: height
    type: int
    description: The height of the texture in pixels.
  - name: withAlpha
    type: bool
    description: The render target will be created with an alpha channel. **false**
      will turn images alpha channels to black color.
    default: 'false'

    description: |
      A render target is like a blank canvas. You can draw on the render target as many times as you like - and even clear it.

      If your dxDraw* calls are static (meaning the appearance doesn't change), or only update periodically, then a render target can be useful not only for cleaner code - but for performance reasons too. Instead of making possibly hundreds of dxDraw* calls every frame, you can simply make those calls on a single frame and draw directly to the render target, then use a single [[dxDrawImage]] call every frame afterwards to display the render target.

      Render targets can also be used to create and display the same thing multiple times, as shown in the example below.

  notes:
  - type: info
    content: Render targets are usually cleared when the player minimizes MTA (i.e. alt-tab). See [[onClientRestore]] for details on when to restore any fixed content.
  - type: tip
    content: |
      - It is highly recommended that [[dxSetTestMode]] is used when writing and testing scripts using **dxCreateRenderTarget**.
      - Use [[dxSetBlendMode]] to get better quality.
      - You should always check to see if this function has returned **false**. To see if creation is likely to fail, use [[dxGetStatus]]. (When **VideoMemoryFreeForMTA** is zero, failure is guaranteed.).
