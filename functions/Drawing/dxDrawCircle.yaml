  notes:
  - type: info
    content: By documentation this function does perform a triangle approximation
      of the cicle . This is important for when there is no shader support on the
      end-user hardware. If there is shader support then you can instead use shaders
      with euler-based math (sin/cos/asin) to create a smoother circle. The performance
      does scale much better than increasing the segment count of this function because
      drawing using shader would take up only one draw-call. Take look at this post
      for more details.

    content: The above remark is about drawing circles on modern end-user hardware
      with angle-interval support, as necessary by example for pie-charts. Drawing
      full circles is easier because the math can be simplified to a euler distance
      calculation from the texcoord (0.5, 0.5) to the currently drawing pixel. Then
      the HLSL clip function can be used to not render any pixels outside of the circle.
