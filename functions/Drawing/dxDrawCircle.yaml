  name: dxDrawCircle
  description: This function draws a circle shape on the screen \- rendered for **one**
    frame. This should be used in conjunction with [onClientRender](/wiki/OnClientRender
    "OnClientRender") in order to be display continuously.
  parameters:
  - name: posX
    type: float
    description: An integer representing the absolute X position of the circle center,
      represented by pixels on the screen.
  - name: posY
    type: float
    description: An integer representing the absolute Y position of the circle center,
      represented by pixels on the screen.
  - name: radius
    type: float
    description: An integer representing the radius scale of the circle that is being
      drawn.
  - name: startAngle
    type: float
    description: An integer representing the angle of the first point of the circle.
    default: '0.0'
  - name: stopAngle
    type: float
    description: An integer representing the angle of the last point of the circle.
    default: '360.0'
  - name: theColor
    type: int
    description: An integer of the hex color, produced using tocolor or 0xAARRGGBB
      (AA = alpha, RR = red, GG = green, BB = blue).
    default: white
  - name: theCenterColor
    type: int
    description: An integer of the hex color, produced using tocolor or 0xAARRGGBB
      (AA = alpha, RR = red, GG = green, BB = blue).
    default: theColor
  - name: segments
    type: int
    description: 'An integer ranging from 3-1024 representing how many triangles are
      used to form the circle, more segments = smoother circle. Note: using lots of
      segments may cause lag.'
    default: '32'
  - name: ratio
    type: int
    description: 'Ratio between width and height, e.g: 2 would mean that the width
      of the circle is 2 times the height.'
    default: '1'
  - name: postGUI
    type: bool
    description: A bool representing whether the circle should be drawn on top of
      or behind any ingame GUI (rendered by CEGUI).
    default: 'false'
  examples:

    description: This function draws a rectangle with rounded corners.
    side: client
  returns:
    values:
    - type: bool
      name: value
    description: Returns true if the creation of the 2D circle was successful, false
      otherwise.
  notes:
  - type: info
    content: By documentation this function does perform a triangle approximation
      of the cicle . This is important for when there is no shader support on the
      end-user hardware. If there is shader support then you can instead use shaders
      with euler-based math (sin/cos/asin) to create a smoother circle. The performance
      does scale much better than increasing the segment count of this function because
      drawing using shader would take up only one draw-call. Take look at this post
      for more details.
  - type: info
    content: The above remark is about drawing circles on modern end-user hardware
      with angle-interval support, as necessary by example for pie-charts. Drawing
      full circles is easier because the math can be simplified to a euler distance
      calculation from the texcoord (0.5, 0.5) to the currently drawing pixel. Then
      the HLSL clip function can be used to not render any pixels outside of the circle.
