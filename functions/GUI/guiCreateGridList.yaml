  name: guiCreateGridList
  description: This function creates a grid list GUI element. These are menu's which
    are designed in lists and can have multiple columns. A good example of a gridlist
    element can be found in MTA's settings box, under *Controls*.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    type: float
    description: A float of the 2D x position of the GUI gridlist on a player's screen.  This
      is affected by the relative argument.
  - name: "y"
    type: float
    description: A float of the 2D y position of the GUI gridlist on a player's screen.
      This is affected by the relative argument.
  - name: width
    type: float
    description: A float of the width of the GUI gridlist. This is affected by the
      relative argument.
  - name: height
    type: float
    description: A float of the height of the GUI gridlist. This is affected by the
      relative argument.
  - name: relative
    type: bool
    description: This is whether sizes and positioning are relative.  If this is true
      , then all x,y,width,height floats must be between 0 and 1, representing sizes
      relative to the parent.
    default: 'false'
  - name: parent
    type: gui-element
    description: This is the parent that the gui gridlist is attached to.  If the
      relative argument is true, sizes and positioning will be made relative to this
      parent. If the relative argument is false, positioning will be the number of
      offset pixels from the parent's origin. If no parent is passed, the parent will
      become the screen - causing positioning and sizing according to screen positioning.
    default: nil
