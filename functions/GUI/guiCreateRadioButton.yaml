  - name: parent

    description: This is the parent that the radio button is attached to. If the relative
      argument is true, sizes and positioning will be made relative to this parent.

      pixels from the parent's origin. If no parent is passed, the parent will become
      the screen - causing positioning and sizing according to screen positioning.
