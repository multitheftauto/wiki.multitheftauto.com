  - name: relative
    type: bool
    description: This is whether sizes and positioning are relative.  If this is true
      , then all x, y, width and height floats must be between 0 and 1, representing
      sizes relative to the parent.
    default: 'false'
  - name: parent
    type: gui-element
    description: This is the parent that the gui button is attached to.  If the relative
      argument is true, sizes and positioning will be made relative to this parent.
      If the relative argument is false, positioning will be the number of offset
      pixels from the parent's origin. If no parent is passed, the parent will become
      the screen - causing positioning and sizing according to screen positioning.
