  description: "This function creates a new CEGUI web [browser](/wiki/Element/Browser\
    \ \"Element/Browser\") element.\n  \nThe difference between this and createBrowser\
    \ is that this function handles inputs internally, and it can be attached to GUI\
    \ windows. So the createBrowser function is more suitable for custom dx based\
    \ interfaces, while this one is favorable for CEGUI all\\-in\\-all integration.\n\
    You can learn more about the differences \\[[here](https://forum.mtasa.com/topic/80422-dx-browser-vs-gui-browser/?do=findComment&comment=737334)]."
  parameters:
  - name: x
    type: float
    description: A float of the 2D x position of the browser on a player's screen.  This
      is affected by the relative argument.
  - name: "y"
    type: float
    description: A float of the 2D y position of the browser on a player's screen.
      This is affected by the relative argument.
  - name: width
    type: float
    description: The browser's native width. This should be greater than or equal
      to 1.
  - name: height
    type: float
    description: The browser's native height. This should be greater than or equal
      to 1.
  - name: isLocal
    type: bool
    description: Sets whether the browser can only show local content or content from
      the internet (see examples over here for more information)
  - name: isTransparent
    type: bool
    description: true if you want the browser to support transparency, false otherwise
  - name: isRelative
    type: bool
    description: This is whether sizes and positioning are relative.  If this is true
      , then all x,y,width,height floats must be between 0 and 1, representing sizes/positions
      as a fraction of the screen size. If false , then the size and co-ordinates
      are based on client's resolution, accessible using guiGetScreenSize .
    default: 'false'
  - name: parent
    type: gui-element
    description: This is the parent that the radio button is attached to. If the relative
      argument is true, sizes and positioning will be made relative to this parent.
      If the relative argument is false, positioning will be the number of offset
      pixels from the parent's origin. If no parent is passed, the parent will become
      the screen - causing positioning and sizing according to screen positioning.
    default: nil
