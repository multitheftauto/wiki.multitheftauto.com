  - name: parent
    type: gui-element
    description: This is the parent that the tab panel is attached to.  If the relative

      If the relative argument is false, positioning will be the number of offset
      pixels from the parent's origin. If no parent is passed, the parent will become
      the screen - causing positioning and sizing according to screen positioning.
