  name: guiCreateLabel
  description: This function is for creating a new GUI label. A label is simply a
    piece of text that cannot be edited by the user. If you would like to have a bigger
    text you'd have to change its font because font size is not supported.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    type: float
    description: A float of the 2D x position of the GUI label on a player's screen.  This
      is affected by the relative argument.
  - name: "y"
    type: float
    description: A float of the 2D y position of the GUI label on a player's screen.
      This is affected by the relative argument.
  - name: width
    type: float
    description: A float of the width of the GUI label. This is affected by the relative
      argument.
  - name: height
    type: float
    description: A float of the height of the GUI label. This is affected by the relative
      argument.
  - name: text
    type: string
    description: A string of the text that will be displayed by the label.
  - name: relative
    type: bool
    description: This is whether sizes and positioning are relative.  If this is true
      , then all x,y,width,height floats must be between 0 and 1, representing sizes
      relative to the parent.
    default: 'false'
  - name: parent
    type: gui-element
    description: This is the parent that the gui label is attached to.  If the relative
      argument is true, sizes and positioning will be made relative to this parent.
      If the relative argument is false, positioning will be the number of offset
      pixels from the parent's origin. If no parent is passed, the parent will become
      the screen - causing positioning and sizing according to screen positioning.
    default: nil
