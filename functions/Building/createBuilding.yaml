  description: Creates a [[building]] element at a given position & interior with a certain rotation.
  notes:
    - type: info
      content: Unlike [[createObject]], this function does not have an **isLowLOD** argument. When using [[setLowLODElement]], the system will automatically define the building as a LOD.

        - Some objects/buildings in interior 13 show in all interiors.
        - Buildings can only be created inside regular GTA:SA Map Boundaries (X between -3000 and 3000; Y between -3000 and 3000). Use [[createObject]] to spawn objects outside these normal limits. **This limitation is probably going to stop existing in the near future.**
        - Buildings cannot appear in certain a [[Dimension]], and not show in others. Function [[setElementDimension]] returns false on any building. A building is created in a specific [[Interior]] world (such as 0, the main world), like the default GTA:SA landscape objects. All buildings appear in **EVERY DIMENSION**.
        - There is a distinction in GTA: San Andreas between static and dynamic models (these use a separate streaming system). Examples of buildings include building models, roads, and terrain. Objects created as [[building]]s **can contain glass and shadows**, unlike those created as [[object]]s (which are missing these features).
        - Buildings can be created with dynamic object model IDs, but they won't have any physical interaction. For example, [object ID 1502 (Gen_doorINT04)](https://dev.prineside.com/en/gtasa_samp_model_id/model/1502-Gen_doorINT04/) is a door that can only be opened if created with [[createObject]].

        - Using buildings for mapping is more optimized than using objects. Gains in FPS can be noticed in areas where a lot of objects were replaced with buildings of this new system.
        - Created buildings can have <b>LOD models</b>. The procedure is as follows: spawn the LOD building using <b>createBuilding</b>, then use [[setLowLODElement]] to associate it with the non-LOD building element you created beforehand. LOD model distance changed with [[engineSetModelLODDistance]] works for buildings.
