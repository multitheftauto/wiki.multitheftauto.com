  - name: targetz
    type: float
    description: the Z value of the target position
  - name: moverx
    type: float
    description: the rotation along the X axis relative to its current rotation, which
      is its starting angle.
  - name: movery
    type: float
    description: the rotation along the Y axis relative to its current rotation, which
      is its starting angle.
  - name: moverz
    type: float
    description: the rotation along the Z axis relative to its current rotation, which
      is its starting angle.
  - name: strEasingType
    type: string
    description: the easing function to use for the interpolation (default is "Linear")
  - name: fEasingPeriod
    type: float
    description: the period of the easing function (only some easing functions use
      this parameter)
  - name: fEasingAmplitude
    type: float
    description: the amplitude of the easing function (only some easing functions
      use this parameter)

    type: float
    description: the overshoot of the easing function (only some easing functions
      use this parameter)
  examples:

    description: Example 1:This example moves every object in the game up 100 units
      in ten seconds.
    side: server
  - path: examples/moveObject-2.lua
    description: Example 2:This example created a model (of a bed) near a player calledsomeguy,
      if they exist in the game. It will then move the model towards the player over
      3 seconds.
    side: server
  - path: examples/moveObject-3.lua
    description: Example 3:This example creates a ball moving (in front of CJ's house
      in Grove Street) using easing functions. Test command is "/smove" for instance
      "/smove OutBounce". This example is a serverside code but the same could be
      done clientside (adapting the command handler)
