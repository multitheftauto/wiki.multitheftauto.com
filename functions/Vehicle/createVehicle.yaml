  notes:
  - type: info
    content: Vehicles (and other elements) created client-side are only seen by the
      client that created them, aren't synced and players cannot enter them. They
      are essentially for display only.
  - type: info
    content: Due to how GTA works, creating a lot of vehicles in the same place will
      cause lag. The more geometries and unique textures has model the bigger the
      lag is. Even a lot of default vehicles will cause lag if in the same place.
