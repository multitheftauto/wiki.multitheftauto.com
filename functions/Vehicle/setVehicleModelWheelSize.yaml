client:
  name: setVehicleModelWheelSize
  description: This function sets the size of a group of wheels for a [vehicle model](/wiki/Vehicle_IDs
    "Vehicle IDs"). The wheel size mainly determines their width, collision box (used
    to check if a bullet hits a tire, for example) and the ground clearance of vehicles
    with that model (i.e., the minimum distance from the center of the car geometry
    to the ground). It also changes the visual scale and rotation of the wheels, if
    not all the wheel groups have equal size. The visual scaling is applied before
    the per\-vehicle [wheel scale](/wiki/SetVehicleWheelScale "SetVehicleWheelScale").

    description: This example replaces the Infernus model with a Huntley model and
      sets the intended wheel scale for the new model accordingly, so that the vehicle
      does not look sunken into the ground.
