  description: Sets the rotor speed of a helicopter or plane. This function now applies
    to both helicopters and planes.
  parameters:
  - name: theVehicle
    type: vehicle
    description: the vehicle (helicopter or plane) to adjust the rotor of.
  - name: speed
    type: float
    description: the new rotor speed. Usual values are 0 if the vehicle is stationary,
      or 0.2 if the rotor is fully spun up. Higher values than normal will not affect
      the vehicle's handling. Negative values are allowed and will make the rotor
      spin in the opposite direction (for helicopters, this pushes it down).
