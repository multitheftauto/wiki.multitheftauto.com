  notes:
  - type: info
    content: The fairings on the NRG-500 and BF-400 are both variants, so unless you
      explicitly ask for 3 or 4, your bike will have no fairings which some people
      may find offensive.
  - type: tip
    content: Both variant arguments need to be supplied, otherwise random ones will
      be picked.
  - type: tip
    content: If you only want one variant, set ' variant2' to 255 . If you want no
      variants, then set both ' variant1' and ' variant2' to 255 .
