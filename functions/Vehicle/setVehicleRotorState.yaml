  name: setVehicleRotorState
  description: Turns the rotor on/off for an plane or helicopter. A vehicle with the
    rotor turned off cannot hover in the air.
  parameters:
  - name: theVehicle
    type: vehicle
    description: The vehicle (helicopter or plane) whose rotor you want to toggle.
  - name: state
    type: bool
    description: The rotor state, which determines whether it should be on ( true
      ) or off ( false ).
  - name: stopRotor
    type: bool
    description: Specifies whether the rotor should be stopped after being turned
      off. If false, the rotor will continue spinning at a constant speed (it won't
      slow down or accelerate). It will also not be able to lift off the ground. You
      can also use setVehicleRotorSpeed to manage the rotor speed.

    description: This example code will add a command called '/rotorstart' that will
      either shut your vehicle's rotors off or start them up again. Do note that once
      rotors are stopped you will simply fall from the sky.
