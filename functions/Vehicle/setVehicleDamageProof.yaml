  notes:
  - type: info
    content: Setting a bike damage proof will have the side-effect of peds not being
      able to get knocked off anymore, even if setPedCanBeKnockedOffBike is set to
      true. Consider using and cancelling the onVehicleDamage / onClientVehicleDamage
      events instead.
