  name: setVehicleWheelScale
  description: This function sets the scale of all the wheels of a [vehicle](/wiki/Vehicle
    "Vehicle"). The wheel scale multiplies the visible height and length (but not
    width) of all the wheels in a vehicle, without affecting their collisions or the
    handling, similarly to [setVehicleComponentScale](/wiki/SetVehicleComponentScale
    "SetVehicleComponentScale"). The wheel scale is applied after the [model wheel
    size](/wiki/SetVehicleModelWheelSize "SetVehicleModelWheelSize").
  parameters:
  - name: theVehicle
    type: vehicle
    description: The vehicle whose wheel scale you wish to modify.
  - name: wheelScale
    type: float
    description: The wheel scale value to set.
  examples:
  - path: examples/setVehicleWheelScale-1.lua
    description: This example adds ashrinkwheelscommand that reduces the wheel scale
      of a vehicle in half each time it is invoked.

    values:
    - type: bool
      name: value
    description: Returns true if the wheel scale has been set successfully, or an
      error if some parameter is invalid.

  notes:
  - type: info
    content: Installing or removing a wheel upgrade from a vehicle resets the wheel
      scale to the default value.
  - type: tip
    content: The default value for vehicles without wheel upgrades is 1, which renders
      the wheels in the model as usual. On the other hand, the default value for vehicles
      with a wheel upgrade is the size of the wheels in the front axle of the vehicle
      model.
