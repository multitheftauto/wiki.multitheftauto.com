  description: This function will take a reference obtained by the [ref](/wiki/Ref
    "Ref") function and returns its Lua element.
  parameters: []
  examples: []
  notes:
  - type: info
    content: This function was originally created to prevent garbage-collection of
      specific Lua objects/elements which should persist even though no script would
      reference them. The storage of those references can be obtained by a call to
      the debug.getregistry function. The ref and deref template can easily be remade
      using a locally-hidden Lua table and two such function implementations.
