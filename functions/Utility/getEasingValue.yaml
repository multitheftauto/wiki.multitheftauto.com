  description: 'Used for custom Lua based interpolation, returns the easing value
    (animation time to use in your custom interpolation) given a progress and an [easing
    function](/wiki/Easing "Easing").

    In most cases, either [moveObject](/wiki/MoveObject "MoveObject") or [interpolateBetween](/wiki/InterpolateBetween
    "InterpolateBetween") can do the job. getEasingValue is only provided in case
    you want to do your own custom interpolation based on easing.'
  parameters:
  - name: fProgress
    type: float
    description: float between 0 and 1 indicating the interpolation progress (0 at
      the beginning of the interpolation, 1 at the end).
  - name: strEasingType
    type: string
    description: the easing function to use for the interpolation
  - name: fEasingPeriod
    type: float
    description: the period of the easing function (only some easing functions use
      this parameter)
  - name: fEasingAmplitude
    type: float
    description: the amplitude of the easing function (only some easing functions
      use this parameter)
  - name: fEasingOvershoot
    type: float
    description: the overshoot of the easing function (only some easing functions
      use this parameter)

    description: 'This clientside example uses getEasingValue to make a custom camera
      fade.

      The command to test it is "/fade".

      The fading out is done with "InQuad" to have a slow fading which then accelerates
      and "OutQuad" is used for fading in to have a smooth end of the fading.

      In this exampleinterpolateBetweencould have been used directly to interpolate
      the alpha between 0 and 255 and then 255 and 0 but is example is just to illustrate
      the use of getEasingValue by itself.'

    values:
    - type: float
      name: value
    description: Returns fAnimationTime the animation time given by the easing function
      (can be < 0 or > 1 since some easing functions have overshoot or bounce/spring
      effects, false otherwise (error in parameters).
