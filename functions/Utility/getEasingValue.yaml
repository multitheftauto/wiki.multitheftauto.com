  description: 'Used for custom Lua based interpolation, returns the easing value
    (animation time to use in your custom interpolation) given a progress and an [easing
    function](/wiki/Easing "Easing").

    In most cases, either [moveObject](/wiki/MoveObject "MoveObject") or [interpolateBetween](/wiki/InterpolateBetween
    "InterpolateBetween") can do the job. getEasingValue is only provided in case
    you want to do your own custom interpolation based on easing.'

    description: 'This clientside example uses getEasingValue to make a custom camera
      fade.

      The command to test it is "/fade".

      The fading out is done with "InQuad" to have a slow fading which then accelerates
      and "OutQuad" is used for fading in to have a smooth end of the fading.

      In this exampleinterpolateBetweencould have been used directly to interpolate
      the alpha between 0 and 255 and then 255 and 0 but is example is just to illustrate
      the use of getEasingValue by itself.'
