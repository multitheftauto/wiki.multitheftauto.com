    on the given string and returns the [base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)
    representation of the encrypted string.
  parameters:
  - name: text

      encode binary data)

    description: Returns the base64 representation of the encrypted string if the

    content: Use encodeString instead, because teaEncode inflates the file size by
      as high as ~77% (or by ~33% if the input isn't binary converted to base64 string).
