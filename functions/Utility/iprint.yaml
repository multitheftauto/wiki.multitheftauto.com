  description: This function intelligently outputs debug messages into the Debug Console.
    It is similar to [outputDebugString](/wiki/OutputDebugString "OutputDebugString"),
    but outputs useful information for **any** variable type, and does not require
    use of Lua's tostring. This includes information about element types, and table
    structures. It is especially useful for quick debug tasks.
