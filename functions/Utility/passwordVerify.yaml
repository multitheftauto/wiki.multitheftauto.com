  description: This function verifies whether a password matches a password hash.
  parameters:
  - name: password
    type: string
    description: The password to check.
  - name: hash
    type: string
    description: A supported hash (see passwordHash ). Note that only the prefix $2y$
      is supported for type bcrypt (older prefixes can cause security issues).
  - name: options
    type: table
    description: 'advanced options insecureBcrypt: If set to true , you can use the
      $2a$ prefix for bcrypt hashes as well. It is strongly not recommended to use
      it though, because the underlying implementation has a bug that leads to such
      hashes being relatively easy to crack. This bug was fixed for $2y$ .'
  - name: callback
    type: function
    description: MISSING_PARAM_DESC
  examples: []
  returns:
    values:
    - type: bool
      name: value
    description: Returns true if the password matches the hash. Returns false if the
      password does not match, or if an unknown hash was passed. If a callback was
      provided, the aforementioned values are arguments to the callback, and this
      function will always return true .
  notes:
  - type: info
    content: Using passwordHash is the recommended way of storing passwords.
  - type: warning
    content: It is strongly recommended to use the async version of the function (i.e.
      provide a callback function). Otherwise, you will experience short freezes due
      to the slow nature of the bcrypt algorithm
