  notes:
  - type: warning
    content: It is strongly recommended to use passwordHash to hash passwords, md5
      is easily decodeable.
  - type: info
    content: It returns an uppercase string, so make sure you string.upper() anything
      else you are checking against that has been MD5'd elsewhere.
  - type: info
    content: This function, along with other hashing algorithms, can be used for a
      plausible script self protection strategy. If done right this strategy does
      present the fact that the script wants to express ownership to a legal entity.
      This can be used as argument in a court of law or for DRM purposes. You can
      find the general idea here .
