client:
  name: getServerIp
  description: This function returns the IP of the server the client is currently
    connected to.
  parameters: []
  examples:
  - path: examples/getServerIp-1.lua
    description: This example creates a console command that outputs the server's
      IP to the chatbox.
    side: client
  notes:
  - type: info
    content: On server-side there is the getServerIpFromMasterServer function, which
      might return the server IP under certain conditions. You should consider using
      a third-party service via fetchServerIp (not an MTA function) if the previous
      function is unreliable for you.
