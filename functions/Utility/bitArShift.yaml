  description: 'This functions performs an arithmetic shift on the integer **value**
    by integer **n** positions. In an *arithmetic shift*, zeros are shifted in to
    replace the discarded bits. In a *right arithmetic* shift, the [sign bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_bit)
    is shifted in on the left, thus preserving the sign of the operand.

    See [Bitwise operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#Arithmetic_shift)
    for more details.'
