  name: encodeString
  description: This function encodes a [string](/wiki/String "String") using the specified
    algorithm. The counterpart of this function is [decodeString](/wiki/DecodeString
    "DecodeString").
  parameters:
  - name: algorithm
    type: string
    description: The algorithm to use.
  - name: input
    type: string
    description: The input to encode.
  - name: options
    type: table
    description: A table with options and other necessary data for the algorithm,
      as detailed below.
  - name: callback
    type: function
    description: providing a callback will run this function asynchronously, the arguments
      to the callback are the same as the returned values below.
  examples:
  - path: examples/encodeString-1.lua
    description: Adds an/encodecommand in which you can provide an algorithm, key
      and data to encode. Below is the example provided as both server-side and client-side
      variations.
    side: server
  - path: examples/encodeString-2.lua
    description: This example shows you how to use the RSA encryption with a simple
      string message.
    side: server
  returns:
    values:
    - type: string
      name: value
  notes:
  - type: tip
    content: If it doesn't matter which algorithm you use for the encoding, keep in
      mind that aes128 uses hardware acceleration so it may outperform the tea algorithm
      on most processors.
