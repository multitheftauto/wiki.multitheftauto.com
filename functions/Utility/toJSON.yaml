  parameters: []
  examples:
  - path: examples/toJSON-1.lua
    description: 'This example shows how you can encode an array. The string json

  notes:
  - type: warning
    content: When using toJSON for submitting data using fetchRemote for example,
      make sure to use string.sub(data, 2, -2) to remove the brackets as many APIs
      will not understand the request
  - type: important
    content: Due to technical limitations (partly of json-c) the stringified keys
      will be truncated to the first 255 characters
  incomplete: true
