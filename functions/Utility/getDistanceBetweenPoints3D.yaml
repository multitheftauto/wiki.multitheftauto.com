    description: Returns a float containing the distance between the two points as
      a float . Returns false if an argument passed was invalid.
  notes:
  - type: info
    content: This function is equivalent to the Vector3 class getLength method when
      used with a vector that holds the direction and distance between two points.
      In other words, it produces exactly the same result as substracting the points'
      coordinates and getting the length of the result vector.
