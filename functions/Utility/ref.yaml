    content: This function was originally created to prevent garbage-collection of
      specific Lua objects/elements which should persist even though no script would
      reference them. The storage of those references can be obtained by a call to
      the debug.getregistry function. Since at the moment MTA does not make use of
      advanced garbage-collector semantics, this function serves little purpose other
      than leak memory!
