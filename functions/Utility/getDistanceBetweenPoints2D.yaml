    description: This example shows the maths behind getting the distance between
      points and is also more efficient if your script is calling this function extremely
      often.

  notes:
  - type: info
    content: This function is equivalent to the Vector2 class getLength method when
      used with a vector that holds the direction and distance between two points.
      In other words, it produces exactly the same result as substracting the points'
      coordinates and getting the length of the result vector.
