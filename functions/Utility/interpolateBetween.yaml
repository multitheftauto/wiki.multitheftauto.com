  description: 'Interpolates a 3D Vector between a source value and a target value
    using either linear interpolation or any other [easing function](/wiki/Easing
    "Easing").

    It can also be used to interpolate 2D vectors or scalars by only setting some
    of the x, y, z values and putting 0 to the others.'

    description: 'This clientside example uses interpolateBetween to create position
      and color interpolation(with effect) on a marker.

      The command to test it is "/marker".

      The position is interpolated with "OutBounce" as strEasingType to make the marker
      bounce off the ground and "Linear" interpolation for the color.'

    description: 'This clientside example uses interpolateBetween to create size and
      position interpolation (with effect) on a gui-window.

      The command to test it is "/window".

      When the window pops up it uses "OutElastic" as the strEasingType to create
      the bouncing/elastic effect.

      When it fades away, it uses "InQuad" to have an accelerating fading.'

      interpolation (with effect) on a camera.

      The command to test it is "/ccam".

      When the camera pops up it uses "OutQuad" as the strEasingType to create the
