  description: 'Interpolates a 3D Vector between a source value and a target value
    using either linear interpolation or any other [easing function](/wiki/Easing
    "Easing").

    It can also be used to interpolate 2D vectors or scalars by only setting some
    of the x, y, z values and putting 0 to the others.'

  - name: fProgress
    type: float
    description: float between 0 and 1 indicating the interpolation progress (0 at
      the beginning of the interpolation, 1 at the end). If it is higher than 1, it
      will start from the beginning.
  - name: strEasingType

    description: the easing function to use for the interpolation
  - name: fEasingPeriod
    type: float
    description: the period of the easing function (only some easing functions use
      this parameter)
  - name: fEasingAmplitude
    type: float
    description: the amplitude of the easing function (only some easing functions
      use this parameter)

    type: float
    description: the overshoot of the easing function (only some easing functions
      use this parameter)
  examples:
  - path: examples/interpolateBetween-1.lua
    description: 'This clientside example uses interpolateBetween to create position
      and color interpolation(with effect) on a marker.

      The command to test it is "/marker".

      The position is interpolated with "OutBounce" as strEasingType to make the marker
      bounce off the ground and "Linear" interpolation for the color.'
    side: client
  - path: examples/interpolateBetween-2.lua
    description: 'This clientside example uses interpolateBetween to create size and
      position interpolation (with effect) on a gui-window.

      The command to test it is "/window".

      When the window pops up it uses "OutElastic" as the strEasingType to create
      the bouncing/elastic effect.

      When it fades away, it uses "InQuad" to have an accelerating fading.'

  - path: examples/interpolateBetween-3.lua
    description: 'This clientside example uses interpolateBetween to create and position
      interpolation (with effect) on a camera.

      The command to test it is "/ccam".

      When the camera pops up it uses "OutQuad" as the strEasingType to create the
      slow down effect.'

    description: 'Returns x, y, z the interpolated 3D vector/value if successful,
      false otherwise (error in parameters).

      As mentioned before, interpolateBetween can be used on 2D vectors or scalars
      in which case only some (x, y or just x) of the returned values are to be used
      (cf. alpha interpolation in marker example or size interpolation in window example).'
