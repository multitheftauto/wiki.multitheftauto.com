  description: This function allows you to trigger a function after a number of milliseconds
    have elapsed. You can call one of your own functions or a built\-in function.
    For example, you could set a timer to spawn a player after a number of seconds
    have elapsed.
  parameters:
  - name: theFunction
    type: function
    description: The function you wish the timer to call.
  - name: timeInterval
    type: int

  - name: timesToExecute

  examples:
  - path: examples/setTimer-1.lua
    description: This example will output some text after a small delay.
    side: server
  - path: examples/setTimer-2.lua
    description: This example will nest a whole function within a timer. This is nice
      for things like setting variables without having to call a function outside
      of your code block.
    side: server
  - path: examples/setTimer-3.lua
    description: This example outputs some random text to the chat every 300000 milliseconds
      (5 minutes).
    side: server
  - path: examples/setTimer-4.lua
    description: This example should send a global message about the death of a player
      on a random time. I usedmath.roundin this example to give a nicer output.
    side: server

    values:
    - type: timer
      name: value
    description: Returns a timer pointer if the timer was set successfully, false
      if the arguments are invalid or the timer could not be set.

  notes:
  - type: info
    content: The hidden global variable sourceTimer contains the currently executing
      timer userdata
  - type: info
    content: The hidden global variable source becomes nil inside a timer function.
      You need to declare it on the function arguments if you need to use it.
  - type: important
    content: The speed at which a client side timer runs can be completely unreliable
      if a client is maliciously modifying their operating system speed, timers could
      run much faster or slower.
  - type: important
    content: Writing the following code can cause performance issues. Use onClientPreRender
      instead. setTimer(theFunction, 0, 0)
