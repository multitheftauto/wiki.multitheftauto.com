  notes:
  - type: info
    content: Due to a rendering bug in GTA, setting transparency for text with outline
      or shadow causes a visual glitch, resulting in blurred/smudged text. Transparency
      only works correctly on text without outline and shadow.
  - type: tip
    content: If the characters are uneven after changing the font, you should set
      the proportional property to true
  - type: tip
    content: The health bar is positioned relative to its width, so after changing
      its width, its position on the X-axis will also change. If you want to maintain
      the bar's position, you also need to calculate its position based on its width.
      Additionally, the width is calculated depending on the MAX_HEALTH stat.
