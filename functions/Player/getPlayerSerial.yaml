    content: It's possible for a player to fake the value returned from getPlayerSerial
      when used on the clientside. For this reason you should only trust the value
      returned by this function when used serverside.
  - type: important
    content: 'You should use this function in conjunction with account system (e.g:
      login & password ) - especially for critical things, because serials could be
      invalid (as in, non-unique or faked ). See: Script security .'
