    content: This function checks if the crosshair is rendered by GTA. Please note
      that hud components are not associated with this function, so the function may
      return true even if the "crosshair" component is hidden with setPlayerHudComponentVisible
      . If you need checking use isPlayerHudComponentVisible .
