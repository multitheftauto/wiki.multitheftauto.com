    content: The direction of the light only has any effect if the light type is spot
      light . One light will only apply illumination effects to peds , players , wheels
      and number plates (like a emergency vehicle siren light does). Two or more lights
      will apply illumination effects to everything (excluding objects) that is in
      range of, at least, two of them.
