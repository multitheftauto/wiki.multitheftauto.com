    description: This function stops all running resources except the current one.
    side: server
  notes:
  - type: info
    content: This function does not stop the resource immediately, so don't expect
      that it starts stopping until the onResourceStop event for that resource is
      triggered. This happens after the scripts are done executing for this server
      frame.
