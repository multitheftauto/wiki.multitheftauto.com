  description: This function restarts a running resource. Restarting will destroy
    all the elements that the resource has created (as stopping the resource does).
  parameters: []

    description: 'Example 1: This function restarts all running resources.'

    description: 'Example 2: This example will restart the specify resource every
      3600000 milliseconds (hour).'

  notes:
  - type: info
    content: Don't forget to give admin rights to the resource, in which you are using
      restartResource function or it won't work. This function does not restart the
      resource immediately. Restarts are queued up until the end of the server's frame
      to ensure that they occur in the correct order (and that dependent resources
      can start and stop correctly). The resource being restarted will have an onResourceStop
      event triggered and the restarted instance will receive an onResourceStart event.
      Remember that the element and resource variables will be invalidated during
      the restart, though of course, the resource's name will not.
