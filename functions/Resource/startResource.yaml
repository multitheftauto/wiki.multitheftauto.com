  name: startResource
  description: This function starts a resource either persistently or as a dependency
    of the current resource. If you start the resource persistently, the resource
    will run until stopped either using [stopResource](/wiki/StopResource "StopResource")
    or by the server admin. A resource started as a dependency will stop when your
    resource stops, if no other resources have it as a depdendency. This is the same
    effect as using an *include* in your [meta.xml](/wiki/Meta.xml "Meta.xml") file.
