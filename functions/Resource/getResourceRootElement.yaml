  name: getResourceRootElement
  description: This function retrieves a resource's root element. The resource's root
    element is the element in the element tree which is the parent of all elements
    that belong to a particular resource (except for elements specifically created
    elsewhere). You can attach event handlers to this element to easily capture events
    that originate from your resource (and global events that originate from the root
    element).
  parameters: []
  examples:
  - path: examples/getResourceRootElement-1.lua
    description: This example retrieves the current resource's root element and attaches
      it to an onResourceStart event handler. This causes the event handler to get
      called only when thecurrentresource is started rather than whenanyresource is
      started, thereby reducing unnecessary overhead.
