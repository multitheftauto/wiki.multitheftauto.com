    description: This example retrieves the current resource's root element and attaches
      it to an onResourceStart event handler. This causes the event handler to get
      called only when thecurrentresource is started rather than whenanyresource is
      started, thereby reducing unnecessary overhead.

  notes:
  - type: info
    content: Every resource has a predefined global variable called resource that
      contains the resource pointer for that resource, in other words, the value that
      this function returns.
