  notes:
  - type: important
    content: Calls (exports) may incur a performance overhead - they are not equivalent
      in performance to calling functions in the same resource. Do not use exports
      in render events (like onClientRender ), or in fast processing logic, unless
      you want to kill performance. The sourceResource and sourceResourceRoot "hidden"
      variables are available even if you use exports.*:* Using this function straight
      away on resource start might cause elements to not be passed properly, use setTimer
      in order to delay function execution and to avoid this issue.
