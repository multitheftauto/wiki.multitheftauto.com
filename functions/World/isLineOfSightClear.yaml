      \ \nThis example demonstrates how you can easily implement basic NPC behaviour\

    content: 'This function does currently NOT support collisions with the "shootthrough"
      flag enabled. That means: isLineOfSightClear will never collide with such collisions
      and this can lead to unreliabilities. The "shootthrough" flag is used by many
      beach/sand/underwater objects.'
