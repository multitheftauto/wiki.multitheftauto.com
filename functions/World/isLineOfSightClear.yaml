  description: This function checks if there are obstacles between two points of the
    game world, optionally ignoring certain kinds of elements. Use [processLineOfSight](/wiki/ProcessLineOfSight
    "ProcessLineOfSight") if you want more information about what the ray hits.
  parameters:
  - name: startX
    type: float
    description: The first point's world X coordinate.
  - name: startY
    type: float
    description: The first point's world Y coordinate.
  - name: startZ
    type: float
    description: The first point's world Z coordinate.
  - name: endX
    type: float
    description: The second point's world X coordinate.
  - name: endY
    type: float
    description: The second point's world Y coordinate.
  - name: endZ
    type: float
    description: The second point's world Z coordinate.
  - name: checkBuildings
    type: bool
    description: Allow the line of sight to be blocked by GTA's internally placed
      buildings, i.e. the world map.
    default: 'true'
  - name: checkVehicles
    type: bool
    description: Allow the line of sight to be blocked by vehicles .
    default: 'true'
  - name: checkPeds
    type: bool
    description: Allow the line of sight to be blocked by peds, i.e. players .
    default: 'true'
  - name: checkObjects
    type: bool
    description: Allow the line of sight to be blocked by objects .
    default: 'true'
  - name: checkDummies
    type: bool
    description: Allow the line of sight to be blocked by GTA's internal dummies.  These
      are not used in the current MTA version so this argument can be set to false
      .
    default: 'true'
  - name: seeThroughStuff
    type: bool
    description: Allow the line of sight to pass through collision materials that
      have this flag enabled (By default material IDs 52, 55 and 66 which are some
      fences). This flag originally allows some objects to be walked on but you can
      shoot throug them.
    default: 'false'
  - name: ignoreSomeObjectsForCamera
    type: bool
    description: Allow the line of sight to pass through objects that have (K) property
      enabled in "object.dat" data file. (i.e. Most dynamic objects like boxes or
      barrels)
    default: 'false'
  - name: ignoredElement
    type: element
    description: Allow the line of sight to pass through a certain specified element.
    default: nil

    description: "isLineOfSightClear is the economical way to cast a ray in the world.\
      \ \nThis example demonstrates how you can easily implement basic NPC behaviour\
      \ such as jumping obstacles. A 3D line is drawn connecting the two points in\
      \ the ray."

    values:
    - type: bool
      name: value
    description: Returns true if the line between the specified points is clear, false
      if there's an obstacle or if invalid parameters are passed.
  notes:
  - type: info
    content: 'This function does currently NOT support collisions with the "shootthrough"
      flag enabled. That means: isLineOfSightClear will never collide with such collisions
      and this can lead to unreliabilities. The "shootthrough" flag is used by many
      beach/sand/underwater objects.'
