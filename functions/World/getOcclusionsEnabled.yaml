  notes:
  - type: info
    content: Occlusions are used by GTA to enhance performance by hiding objects that
      are (normally) obscured by certain large buildings. However when removeWorldModel
      is used they may also have the undesired effect of making parts of the map disappear.
      Disabling occlusions will fix that.
