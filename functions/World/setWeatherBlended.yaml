  description: This function will change the current [weather](/wiki/Weather "Weather")
    to another in a smooth manner, over the period of 1\-2 in\-game hours (unlike
    [setWeather](/wiki/SetWeather "SetWeather"), which sets a new weather instantly).
    To ensure this transition performs as expected, you should not call this function
    until [getWeather](/wiki/GetWeather "GetWeather") indicates that no transition
    is already being done.
  parameters:
  - name: weatherID
    type: int
    description: The ID of the weather state you wish to set. Valid values are 0 to
      255 inclusive.

    description: This example sets the weather to sunny, then makes it change to a
      foggy over the period of one-two hours (assuming that a in-game hour is a minute
      in real time).
