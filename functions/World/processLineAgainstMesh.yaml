  description: 'Does a raycast against an element''s renderable mesh model \[not the
    collision model!].

    The same functionality is already present in [processLineOfSight](/wiki/ProcessLineOfSight
    "ProcessLineOfSight"), but the latter is a little buggy due to the fact that the
    collision model is always simplified, and not exactly the same as the mesh, which
    leads to situations where no hit is detected, even though the visible mesh is
    hittable \[or vice versa].

    Also, when one is interested in a specific element the overhead is a lot smaller
    \[as we can skip all the collision detection done by the before\-mentioned function].'
