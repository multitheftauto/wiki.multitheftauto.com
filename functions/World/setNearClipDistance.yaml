  name: setNearClipDistance
  description: 'This function sets the distance from the [camera](/wiki/Camera "Camera")
    at which the world starts rendering. Do not use this function unless you have
    a specific reason to do so, as any values can cause artifacts and flickering problems.
    It can be used in many ways, including: reducing Z\-fighting, creating more sophisticated
    first person views, allowing the camera to fly closer to the ground without passing
    through it, etcetera.'
  parameters:
  - name: distance
    type: float
    description: the new near clip distance. It must be between 0.1 and 20 for the
      function to do any effect. Default value is 0.3 .
  examples:

    description: This example allows the camera to be nearer to ground level without
      viewing what is under it.

    values:
    - type: bool
      name: value
    description: This function returns true if the argument is valid. Returns false
      otherwise.
  notes:
  - type: info
    content: setNearClipDistance should only be used when the camera orientation is
      controlled by setCameraMatrix , because GTA automatically adjusts this value
      for the optimum setting when the camera is attached to a player. Therefore ensure
      resetNearClipDistance is called when returning camera control back to GTA.
