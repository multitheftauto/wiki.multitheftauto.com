  description: 'This function sets the distance from the [camera](/wiki/Camera "Camera")
    at which the world starts rendering. Do not use this function unless you have
    a specific reason to do so, as any values can cause artifacts and flickering problems.
    It can be used in many ways, including: reducing Z\-fighting, creating more sophisticated
    first person views, allowing the camera to fly closer to the ground without passing
    through it, etcetera.'

  notes:
  - type: info
    content: setNearClipDistance should only be used when the camera orientation is
      controlled by setCameraMatrix , because GTA automatically adjusts this value
      for the optimum setting when the camera is attached to a player. Therefore ensure
      resetNearClipDistance is called when returning camera control back to GTA.
