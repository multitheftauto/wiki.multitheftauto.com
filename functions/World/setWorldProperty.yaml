  notes:
  - type: info
    content: This function only adds remaining time cycle properties. You need to
      use existing world functions to override other properties (like sun color).
  - type: tip
    content: This function can be used to implement custom time cycles and other advanced
      weather features. It allows you to override values set by the game for weathers
      (timecyc.dat). The downside of overriding is the need to implement custom blending
      (to change weather properties over time creating night / day cycle).
