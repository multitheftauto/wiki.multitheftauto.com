  name: getScreenFromWorldPosition
  description: This function gets the screen position of a point in the world. This
    is useful for attaching 2D gui elements to parts of the world (e.g. players) or
    detecting if a point is on the screen (though it does not check if it is actually
    visible, you should use [processLineOfSight](/wiki/ProcessLineOfSight "ProcessLineOfSight")
    for that).
  parameters: []

  - path: examples/getScreenFromWorldPosition-1.lua
