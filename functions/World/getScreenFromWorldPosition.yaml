  name: getScreenFromWorldPosition
  description: This function gets the screen position of a point in the world. This
    is useful for attaching 2D gui elements to parts of the world (e.g. players) or
    detecting if a point is on the screen (though it does not check if it is actually
    visible, you should use [processLineOfSight](/wiki/ProcessLineOfSight "ProcessLineOfSight")
    for that).
  parameters:
  - name: x
    type: float
    description: A float value indicating the x position in the world.
  - name: "y"
    type: float
    description: A float value indicating the y position in the world.
  - name: z
    type: float
    description: A float value indicating the z position in the world.
  - name: edgeTolerance
    type: float
    description: 'A float value indicating the distance the position can be off screen
