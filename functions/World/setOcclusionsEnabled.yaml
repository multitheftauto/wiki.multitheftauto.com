  description: This function is used to enable or disable occlusions. Occlusions are
    used by GTA to enhance performance by hiding objects that are (normally) obscured
    by certain large buildings. However when [removeWorldModel](/wiki/RemoveWorldModel
    "RemoveWorldModel") is used they may also have the undesired effect of making
    parts of the map disappear. Disabling occlusions will fix that.

      has been cleared:'
