client:
  name: processLineOfSight
  description: This function casts a ray between two points in the world, and tells
    you information about the point that was hit, if any. The two positions **must**
    be within the local player's draw distance as the collision data is not loaded
    outside this area, and the call will just fail as if the ray didn't hit.
  parameters: []
  examples:
  - path: examples/processLineOfSight-1.lua
    description: This example shows how you can tell what position and element the
      camera is looking at, up to 50 units away.

    description: This example shows how you can get the surface type a vehicle is
      on. This is useful if you want to do a script to dirt cars over time. Please
      note that this function doesn't count if the vehicle is streamed in or not,
      so expect this function to fail or return incorrect values on unloaded vehicles.

  notes:
  - type: info
    content: Due to a bug, shootThroughStuff argument does currently check for seeThroughStuff!
  - type: info
    content: Due to a bug, seeThroughStuff argument has no effect. It mistakenly checks
      for "shootThrough" surfaces and will always behave as if the argument is set
      to FALSE (It will never hit).
