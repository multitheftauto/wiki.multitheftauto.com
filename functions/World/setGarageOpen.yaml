    content: setGarageOpen does not work with ID 32 (Pay 'n' Spray near Royal Casino).
      This garage has been disabled by Rockstar Games due to floor collision issues
      (see TheJizzy's video "BETA Leftovers and Glitches" at 12:12 timestamp). You
      can remove the door by using removeWorldModel and recreating it for later with
      moveObject .
