  name: createColPolygon
  description: This function creates a collision polygon. See [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon)
    for a definition of a polygon. The first set of X Y of this shape is not part
    of the colshape bounds, so can set anywhere in the game world, however for performance,
    place it as close to the centre of the polygon as you can. It should be noted
    this shape is **2D**. There should be at least 3 bound points set.
  parameters:
  - name: fCenterX
    type: float
    description: The X position of the collision polygon's position - the position
      that will be returned from getElementPosition .
  - name: fCenterY
    type: float
    description: The Y position of the collision polygon's position - the position
      that will be returned from getElementPosition .
  - name: fX1
    type: float
    description: The 1st X position of the collision polygon's bound point
  - name: fY1
    type: float
    description: The 1st Y position of the collision polygon's bound point
  - name: fX2
    type: float
    description: The 2nd X position of the collision polygon's bound point
  - name: fY2
    type: float
    description: The 2nd Y position of the collision polygon's bound point
  - name: fX3
    type: float
    description: The 3rd X position of the collision polygon's bound point
  - name: fY3
    type: float
    description: The 3rd Y position of the collision polygon's bound point
  - name: '...'

  notes:
  - type: info
    content: For this function to work correctly, get/set your bound points in an
      anti-clockwise fashion.
  - type: info
    content: Even though this is a 2D colshape, isElementWithinColShape returns false
      if an element is in the area but below 0 Z height.
  - type: tip
    content: To visualize a colshape when writing scripts, use the client console
      command showcol
