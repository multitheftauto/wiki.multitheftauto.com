  name: createColPolygon
  description: This function creates a collision polygon. See [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon)
    for a definition of a polygon. The first set of X Y of this shape is not part
    of the colshape bounds, so can set anywhere in the game world, however for performance,
    place it as close to the centre of the polygon as you can. It should be noted
    this shape is **2D**. There should be at least 3 bound points set.
  parameters: []
  examples:
  - path: examples/createColPolygon-1.lua
    description: This example displays a chat message when any element hits the colshape
      and allows the colshape to be created using a console functionset_zone.

    content: For this function to work correctly, get/set your bound points in an
      anti-clockwise fashion.

      if an element is in the area but below 0 Z height.
  - type: tip
    content: To visualize a colshape when writing scripts, use the client console
      command showcol
