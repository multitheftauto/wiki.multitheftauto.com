  name: createColPolygon
  description: This function creates a collision polygon. See [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon)
    for a definition of a polygon. The first set of X Y of this shape is not part
    of the colshape bounds, so can set anywhere in the game world, however for performance,
    place it as close to the centre of the polygon as you can. It should be noted
    this shape is **2D**. There should be at least 3 bound points set.
  parameters:
  - name: fCenterX
    type: float
    description: The X position of the collision polygon's position - the position
      that will be returned from [[getElementPosition]].
  - name: fCenterY
    type: float
    description: The Y position of the collision polygon's position - the position
      that will be returned from [[getElementPosition]].
  - name: fX1
    type: float
    description: The 1st X position of the collision polygon's bound point
  - name: fY1
    type: float
    description: The 1st Y position of the collision polygon's bound point
  - name: fX2
    type: float
    description: The 2nd X position of the collision polygon's bound point
  - name: fY2
    type: float
    description: The 2nd Y position of the collision polygon's bound point
  - name: fX3
    type: float
    description: The 3rd X position of the collision polygon's bound point
  - name: fY3
    type: float
    description: The 3rd Y position of the collision polygon's bound point
  - name: '...'
    type: ''
    description: From the 3rd position you can have as many points as you require to create the colshape.
  returns:
    values:
    - type: colshape|false
      name: col-polygon
    description: Returns a [[colshape]] element if successful, **false** if invalid arguments
      were passed to the function.

  notes:
  - type: info
    content: |
      - For this function to work correctly, get/set your bound points in an
      anti-clockwise fashion.
      - Even though this is a 2D colshape, [[isElementWithinColShape]] returns **false**
      if an element is in the area but below 0 Z height.
  - type: tip
    content: To visualize a colshape when writing scripts, use the client console command [showcol](/articles/Client_commands#showcol).
