  name: createColTube
  description: This function creates a collision tube. This is a shape that has a
    position and a 2D (X/Y) radius and a height. See [Cylinder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry))
    for a definition of a tube. A tube is similar to a [colcircle](/reference/createColCircle), except that it has
    a limited height, this means you can limit the distance above the position defined
    by (fX, fY, fZ) that the collision is detected.
  parameters:
  - name: fX
    type: float
    description: The position of the base of the tube's center on the X axis.
  - name: fY
    type: float
    description: The position of the base of the tube's center on the Y axis.
  - name: fZ
    type: float
    description: The position of the base of the tube's center on the Z axis.
  - name: fRadius
    type: float
    description: The collision tube's radius.
  - name: fHeight
    type: float
    description: The collision tube's height.
