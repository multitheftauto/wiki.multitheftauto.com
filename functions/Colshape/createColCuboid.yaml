  notes:
  - type: info
    content: Attaching a cuboid colshape to another element may give unexpected results
      as the origin is not at the cuboid centre. Try using a [collision sphere](/reference/createColSphere) for
      attaching instead.
  - type: tip
    content: To visualize a colshape when writing scripts, use the client console command [showcol](/articles/Client_commands#showcol).
