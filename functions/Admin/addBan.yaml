        Banning based on username is not recommended, because the player can change their nickname at any time and thus bypass the ban.
        This feature is a leftover from the times when MTA used [MTA Community](http://community.mtasa.com/) accounts for gameplay â€” today it's an outdated option, kept only for backward compatibility.
    - type: warning
      content: Banning based solely on IP is not recommended, as a player can change their IP, for example by using a VPN. The safest option is to ban the [[serial]].
