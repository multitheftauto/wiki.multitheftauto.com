  notes:
  - type: info
    content: When the water level is 0, the standard GTA rendering is performed so
      that water is visible when viewed through translucent surfaces, such as vehicle
      windows. However, some MTA custom objects placed underwater will appear in front
      of the water. Setting the water level to any non-zero value (i.e. setWaterLevel(0.001)
      ) forces alternative rendering and MTA custom objects placed underwater will
      be drawn correctly.
