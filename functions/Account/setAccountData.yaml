  description: This function sets a string to be stored in an [account](/wiki/Account
    "Account"). This can then be retrieved using [getAccountData](/wiki/GetAccountData
    "GetAccountData"). Data stored as account data is persistent across user's sessions
    and maps, unless they are logged into a guest account. Even if logged into a guest
    account, account data can be useful as a way to store a reference to your own
    account system, though it's persistence is equivalent to that of using [setElementData](/wiki/SetElementData
    "SetElementData") on the player's element.

    description: For a pirate roleplaying gametype, the amount of money a player has
      is made persistent by storing it in his account. Note the code uses "piraterpg.money"
      as key instead of just "money", as the player may be participating in other
      gametypes that also save his money amount to his account. If both gametypes
      would use "money" as the account key, they'd overwrite each other's data.
