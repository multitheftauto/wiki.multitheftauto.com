  pair: getAccountData
  description: |
    This function sets a string to be stored in an [[account]]. 
    This can then be retrieved using [[getAccountData]]. 
    Data stored as account data is persistent across user's sessions and maps, unless they are logged into a guest account.
    Even if logged into a guest account, account data can be useful as a way to store a reference to your own account system, though it's persistence is equivalent to that of using [[setElementData]] on the player's element.
  notes:
    - type: info
      content: You cannot store tables as values, but you can use [[toJSON]] strings.

        For a pirate roleplaying gametype, the amount of money a player has is made persistent by storing it in his account. Note the code uses <code>piraterpg.money</code> as key instead of just <code>money</code>, as the player may be participating in other gametypes that also save his money amount to his account. 
        If both gametypes would use <code>money</code> as the account key, they'd overwrite each other's data.
