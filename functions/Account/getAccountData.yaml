    description: For a pirate roleplaying gametype, the amount of money a player has
      is made persistent by storing it in his account. Note the code uses "piraterpg.money"
      as key instead of just "money", as the player may be participating in other
      gametypes that also save his money amount to his account. If both gametypes
      would use "money" as the account key, they'd overwrite each other's data.
