        For a pirate roleplaying gametype, the amount of money a player has is made persistent by storing it in his account. Note the code uses <code>piraterpg.money</code> as key instead of just <code>money</code>, as the player may be participating in other gametypes that also save his money amount to his account. 
        If both gametypes would use <code>money</code> as the account key, they'd overwrite each other's data.
