  description: This function checks to see if an [account](/wiki/Account "Account")
    is a guest account. A guest account is an account automatically created for a
    user when they join the server and deleted when they quit or login to another
    account. Data stored in a guest account is not stored after the player has left
    the server. As a consequence, this function will check if a player is logged in
    or not.
