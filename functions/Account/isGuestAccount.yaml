server:
  name: isGuestAccount
  description: |
    This function checks to see if an [[account]] is a guest account. A guest account is an account automatically created for a user when they join the server and deleted when they quit or login to another account. Data stored in a guest account **is not stored** after the player has left the server.
    As a consequence, this function will check if a [[player]] is logged in or not.
