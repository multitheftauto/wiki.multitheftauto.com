  description: This function will fade a player's camera to a color or back to normal
    over a specified time period. This will also affect the sound volume for the player
    (50% faded \= 50% volume, full fade \= no sound). For clientside scripts you can
    perform 2 fade ins or fade outs in a row, but for serverside scripts you must
    use one then the other.
