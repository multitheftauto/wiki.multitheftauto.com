  name: setCameraMatrix
  pair: getCameraMatrix
  description: This function sets the camera's position and direction. The first three arguments are the point at which the camera lies, the last three are the point the camera faces (or the point it "looks at").
  oop:
    - element: player
      method: setCameraMatrix

  notes:
    - type: info
      content: Calling this function takes the camera's focus away from the player and sets the camera in a fixed position and rotation. The camera's focus can be brought back to the player using the [[setCameraTarget]] function.
    - type: tip
      content: Instead of six coordinates, or two vectors, a [[Matrix]] can be supplied as position.
  parameters:
    - name: thePlayer
      type: player
      description: The player whose camera is to be changed.
    - name: positionX
      type: float
      description: The x coordinate of the camera's position.
    - name: positionY
      type: float
      description: The y coordinate of the camera's position.
    - name: positionZ
      type: float
      description: The z coordinate of the camera's position.
    - name: lookAtX
      type: float
      description: The x coordinate of the point the camera faces.
      default: '0'
    - name: lookAtY
      type: float
      description: The y coordinate of the point the camera faces.
      default: '0'
    - name: lookAtZ
      type: float
      description: The z coordinate of the point the camera faces.
      default: '0'
    - name: roll
      type: float
      description: The camera roll angle, -180 to 180. A value of 0 means the camera sits straight, positive values will turn it counter-clockwise and negative values will turn it clockwise. -180 or 180 means the camera is upside down.
      default: '0'
    - name: fov
      type: float
      description: The field of view angle, 0.01 to 179. The higher this value is, the more you will be able to see what is to your sides.
