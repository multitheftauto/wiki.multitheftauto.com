  - type: info
    content: The only supported audio formats are MP3, WAV, OGG, FLAC, RIFF, MOD,
      WEBM, XM, IT and S3M. For performance reasons, when using playSound3D for effects
      that will be played lots (i.e. weapon fire), it is recommend that you convert
      your audio file to a one channel (mono) WAV with sample rate of 22050 Hz or
      less. Also consider adding a limit on how often the effect can be played e.g.
      once every 50ms.
