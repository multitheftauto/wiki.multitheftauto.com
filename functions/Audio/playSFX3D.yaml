        Many players use versions of GTA:SA (especially pirated versions) that have audio files full of zeros so that they can compress better in their <b>AUDIO\\SFX\\</b> folder. (They lack any data).
        
        In case of these invalid audio files, this function returns false. It also returns false when trying to play a track deleted in the recent GTA: SA Steam patches (and if the client is using a Steam GTA: SA copy).
