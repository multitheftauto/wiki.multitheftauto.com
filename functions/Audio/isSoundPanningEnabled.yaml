    description: This example plays axy.mp3file in the root folder of the resource
      which contains it at the center of the map, and proves that by default a sound
      enables panning by outputting the result of this function to the chatbox right

  - type: tip
    content: Although this function works in no-3D sounds (those created by playSound
      ), it only makes sense to use it with 3D sounds (created by playSound3D ). Please
      refer to setSoundPanningEnabled for a explanation of what this property does.
