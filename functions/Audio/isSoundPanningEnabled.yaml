  notes:

      content: Although this function works in no-3D sounds (those created by [[playSound]]), it only makes sense to use it with 3D sounds (created by [[playSound3D]]). Please refer to [[setSoundPanningEnabled]] for a explanation of what this property does.

  examples:
    - path: examples/isSoundPanningEnabled-1.lua
      description: This example plays a xy.mp3 file in the root folder of the resource which contains it at the center of the map, and proves that by default a sound enables panning by outputting the result of this function to the chatbox right after creating it. Then it disables the panning of the sound.
