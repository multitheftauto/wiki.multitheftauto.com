  examples:
    - path: examples/isSoundPanningEnabled-1.lua
      description: This example plays a xy.mp3 file in the root folder of the resource which contains it at the center of the map, and proves that by default a sound enables panning by outputting the result of this function to the chatbox right after creating it. Then it disables the panning of the sound.
