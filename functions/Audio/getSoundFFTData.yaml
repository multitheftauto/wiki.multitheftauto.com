  description: 'This function gets the fast fourier transform data for an audio stream
    which is a table of floats representing the current audio frame. This allows things
    like visualisations.

    A fast fourier transform generates a table of all the frequencies of the current
    audio frame which starts at the bass end of the spectrum to mids to highs in that
    order.

    Should you have any problems there is an example resource located on the resources
    repository:
