    content: The only supported audio formats are MP3, WAV, OGG, FLAC, RIFF, MOD,
      WEBM, XM, IT, S3M and PLS (e.g. Webstream). For performance reasons, when using
      playSound for effects that will be played lots (i.e. weapon fire), it is recommend
      that you convert your audio file to a one channel (mono) WAV with sample rate
      of 22050 Hz or less. Also consider adding a limit on how often the effect can
      be played e.g. once every 50ms.
