  description: This function gets the beats per minute of a specific [sound](/wiki/Sound
    "Sound") element.
  parameters: []

  - type: warning
    content: This function is expensive to call and will freeze the client about 1-3
      seconds. Also, trying to get the BPM from a sound directly after its creation
      will make the sound start only after the client freeze. You can use a setTimer
      to call this function after song creation so it can play normally.
