    side: server
  notes:
  - type: info
    content: It might take a while until the master server responds to the query sent
      out by the server, which in turn means that this function will not return any
      IP until the information has been received.
  - type: info
    content: On client-side there is the getServerIp function, in case you need the
      remote address of the currently connected server.
  - type: info
    content: If you want to retrieve the server IP address from the server configuration,
      then you should use getServerConfigSetting("serverip") , but this might yield
      only "auto" if the default value was used.
