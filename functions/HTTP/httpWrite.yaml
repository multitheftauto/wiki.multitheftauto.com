  description: This function adds text to the output of the current HTTP file of the
    [HTTP interface](/wiki/Resource_Web_Access "Resource Web Access"). The function
    can only be used on parsed (i.e not marked as *raw*) HTTP pages. httpWrite can
    support outputing binary data, if you specify the length of the data you are outtputing.
    If you do this, you should ensure you set an accurate content\-type using [httpSetResponseHeader](/wiki/HttpSetResponseHeader
    "HttpSetResponseHeader") otherwise it may be displayed inconsistently by browsers.

    description: Example 1:This sample resource page will output a random quote from
      a player using a function previously exported to http from a Lua script in the
      resource.

    description: Example 2:Using httpWrite to return a file read in withfileRead.
      This is useful as the internal server doesn't not support subdirectories reliably
      so you can create a page to return files to you.
