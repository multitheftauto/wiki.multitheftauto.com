  name: setPedCameraRotation
  description: This function sets the camera rotation of a ped, e.g. where its camera
    will look at. Don't confuse this with [getCameraMatrix](/wiki/GetCameraMatrix
    "GetCameraMatrix"), because that function is designed for fixed (scripted) camera
    moves.
  parameters:
  - name: thePed
    type: ped
    description: The ped whose camera rotation is to be changed.
  - name: cameraRotation
    type: float
    description: The new direction that the ped will walk if you set their forwards
      control state. If the ped is the local player, it will also change where his
      camera is looking at if it isn't fixed (i.e. camera target is the local player).
  examples:

      the camera of the player who uses it.
