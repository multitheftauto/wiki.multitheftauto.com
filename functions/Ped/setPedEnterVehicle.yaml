    content: 'This function only works within the following limits: If forced to enter
      as a passenger, it doesn''t work if all passenger seats are occupied. Only the
      driver seat can be jacked. If forced to enter as a driver, the ped can carjack
      the current driver. If the driver''s door is blocked by something, the ped can
      use the opposite front door to reach the driver''s seat, jacking the passenger
      in the process. If a vehicle is not specified: The ped will search for a vehicle
      door within 20 m. If the vehicle has a driver, the limit becomes 10 m. If a
      vehicle is specified: The vehicle has to be within 50 m. The doors aren''t taken
      into account. It means that it doesn''t work if the vehicle''s door is in range
      but the vehicle itself is not. If the vehicle has a driver, the limit becomes
      10 m. When entering, the ped will run toward a vehicle if it is less than 50
      m away. The ped reserves the seat he is trying to use. It means nobody can enter
      the respective seat while the ped is running toward it. Exception: If the ped
      is forced to enter as a passenger and is going to use the front door, the ped
      can wait if someone is using it to go the driver seat.'
