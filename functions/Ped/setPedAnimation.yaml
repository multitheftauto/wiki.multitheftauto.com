  name: setPedAnimation
  description: Sets the current [animation](/wiki/Animations "Animations") of a [player](/wiki/Player
    "Player") or [ped](/wiki/Ped "Ped"). Not specifying the type of animation will
    automatically cancel the current one.
  parameters:
  - name: thePed
    type: ped
    description: the player or ped you want to apply an animation to.
  - name: block
    type: string
    description: the animation block's name.
    default: nil
  - name: anim
    type: string
    description: the name of the animation within the block.
    default: nil
  - name: time
    type: int
    description: how long the animation will run for in milliseconds.
    default: '-1'
  - name: loop
    type: bool
    description: indicates whether or not the animation will loop.
    default: 'true'
  - name: updatePosition
    type: bool
    description: will change the actual coordinates of the ped according to the animation.
      Use this for e.g. walking animations.
    default: 'true'
  - name: interruptable
    type: bool
    description: if set to false other tasks wont be able to interupt the animation.
      Setting this to 'false' also gives this function more power to override other
      animations that are running. For example, squatting after a jump can be terminated.
    default: 'true'
  - name: freezeLastFrame
    type: bool
    description: if set to true after animation the last frame will be frozen, otherwise
      the animation will end and controls will return.
    default: 'true'
  - name: blendTime
    type: int
    description: how long the animation will mixed with the previous one in milliseconds.
    default: '250'
  - name: retainPedState
    type: bool
    description: MISSING_PARAM_DESC
    default: 'false'

    content: It is possible that an animation will be cancelled if you use setElementFrozen
      on the ped, but this does not happen all the time.
