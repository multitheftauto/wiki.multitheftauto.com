  notes:
  - type: info
    content: You can't use enter_exit or enter_passenger on a ped. Please use setPedEnterVehicle
      and setPedExitVehicle .
  - type: info
    content: To make a ped crouch, set the control to true and reset to false after
      one frame. Use setTimer with 0ms. Do the same to make the ped stand again.
  - type: info
    content: If you set the control state on the localPlayer element, then the control
      state is synchronized to every other client as if the input was made through
      the game input. But if you set any control states to server-side peds then the
      control state is not automatically synchronized. This behaviour is unaffected
      by being the syncer of the server-side ped or not. Let's assume that the syncer
      client calls setPedControlState on the ped. The other game clients - the ones
      where setPedControlState was not manually called by scripts - will see the ped
      teleport around. It will clearly look as if synchronization were broken.
