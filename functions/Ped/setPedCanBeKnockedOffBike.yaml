  notes:
  - type: info
    content: This effect is not synced for peds. When the ped falls off, he will not
      have exited the vehicle. To get it working you need to call it each time the
      ped is streamed in & each time it gets a new syncer.
  - type: info
    content: The ped will not get knocked off a bike that is set damage proof through
      setVehicleDamageProof . Refer to the note on that method for more information.
