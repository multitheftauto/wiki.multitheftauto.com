server:
  name: triggerClientEvent
  description: This function triggers an event previously registered on a client.
    This is the primary means of passing information between the server and the client.
    Clients have a similar [triggerServerEvent](/wiki/TriggerServerEvent "TriggerServerEvent")
    function that can do the reverse. You can treat this function as if it was an
    asynchronous function call, using [triggerServerEvent](/wiki/TriggerServerEvent
    "TriggerServerEvent") to pass back any returned information if necessary.

  notes:
  - type: info
    content: It is marginally more efficient to pass one large event than two smaller
      ones.
  - type: important
    content: Non-element MTA data types like xmlNodes or resource pointers will not
      be able to be passed as they do not necessarily have a valid representation
      on the client.
  - type: important
    content: To save client CPU, you should avoid setting theElement to the root element
      where possible - it should be used as a last resort (rather questionable thing
      to do, limited to very specific tasks, if any). Using target element ( player
      who should receive event, if expected to be delivered to particular one) is
      preferred and highly advisable. resourceRoot can also be used as alternative
      choice, if addEventHandler is bound to root element, or to resourceRoot when
      there is need to restrict event to single certain resource.
