server:
  name: triggerClientEvent
  description: | 
    This function triggers an event previously registered on a client.
    This is the primary means of passing information between the server and the client.
    Clients have a similar [triggerServerEvent](/reference/triggerServerEvent "TriggerServerEvent")
    function that can do the reverse. You can treat this function as if it was an
    asynchronous function call, using [triggerServerEvent](/reference/triggerServerEvent
    "TriggerServerEvent") to pass back any returned information if necessary.

    Almost any data types can be passed as expected, including [elements](/reference/Element "Element") and complex nested [tables](/reference/table "Table"). Non-element MTA data types like [xmlNodes](/reference/xmlnode "XML Node") or resource pointers will not be able to be passed as they do not necessarily have a valid representation on the client.

    Events are sent reliably, so clients will receive them, but there may be (but shouldn't be) a significant delay before they are received. You should take this into account when using them.
    
    Keep in mind the bandwidth issues when using events - don't pass a large list of arguments unless you really need to. It is marginally more efficient to pass one large event than two smaller ones.
  parameters:
  - name: sendTo
    type: 'table/element'
    description: The event will be sent to all [players](/reference/player "Player") that are children of the specified element. By default this is the [root](/reference/root "Root") element, and hence the event is sent to all players. If you specify a single player it will just be sent to that player. This argument can also be a table of player elements.
    default: getRootElement(
  - name: name
    type: string
    description: The name of the event to trigger client side. You should register this event with [[addEvent]] and add at least one event handler using [[addEventHandler]].
  - name: sourceElement
    type: element
    description: The element that is the [source](/reference/Event_System "Event System") of the event.
  - name: arguments
    type: 'mixed'
    description: A list of arguments to trigger with the event. You can pass any lua data type (except functions). You can also pass [elements](/reference/Element "Element").
    default: 'nil'

  notes:
  - type: info
    content: It is marginally more efficient to pass one large event than two smaller
      ones.
  - type: important
    content: Non-element MTA data types like [xmlNodes](/reference/xmlnode "XML Node") or resource pointers will not
      be able to be passed as they do not necessarily have a valid representation
      on the client.
  - type: important
    content: To save client CPU, you should avoid setting theElement to the [root](/reference/root "Root") element
      where possible - it should be used as a last resort (rather questionable thing
      to do, limited to very specific tasks, if any). Using target element ( [player](/reference/player "Player")
      who should receive event, if expected to be delivered to particular one) is
      preferred and highly advisable. [resourceRoot](/reference/resourceRoot "ResourceRoot") can also be used as alternative
      choice, if [addEventHandler](/reference/addEventHandler "addEventHandler") is bound to [root](/reference/root "Root") element, or to [resourceRoot](/reference/resourceRoot "ResourceRoot") when
      there is need to restrict event to single certain resource.
