    This function checks if the last completed event was cancelled. This is mainly useful for custom events created by scripts.

    Events can be cancelled using [[cancelEvent]], this indicates that the resource which triggered the event should do whatever it can to reverse any changes made by whatever caused the event. See [[triggerEvent]] for a more detailed explanation of this.
