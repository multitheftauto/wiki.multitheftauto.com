client:
  name: triggerServerEvent
  description: This function triggers an event previously registered on the server.
    This is the primary means of passing information between the client and the server.
    Servers have a similar [triggerClientEvent](/wiki/TriggerClientEvent "TriggerClientEvent")
    function that can do the reverse. You can treat this function as if it was an
    asynchronous function call, using [triggerClientEvent](/wiki/TriggerClientEvent
    "TriggerClientEvent") to pass back any returned information if necessary.

  notes:
  - type: info
    content: It is marginally more efficient to pass one large event than two smaller
      ones.
  - type: important
    content: 'You should use the global variable client server-side instead of passing
      the localPlayer by parameter or source. Otherwise event faking (passing another
      player instead of the localPlayer ) would be possible. For more information
      see: Script security article.'
  - type: important
    content: To save server CPU, you should avoid setting theElement to the root element
      where possible - it should be used as a last resort (rather questionable thing
      to do, limited to very specific tasks, if any). Using localPlayer is preferred
      and highly advisable. resourceRoot can also be used as alternative choice, if
      addEventHandler is bound to root element, or to resourceRoot when there is need
      to restrict event to single certain resource (although cheater could still trigger
      it from different resource, by using getResourceRootElement and passing respective
      resource root element)
