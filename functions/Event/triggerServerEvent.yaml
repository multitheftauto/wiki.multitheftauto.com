client:
  name: triggerServerEvent
  description: |
    This function triggers an event previously registered on the server.
    This is the primary means of passing information between the client and the server.
    Servers have a similar [triggerClientEvent](/reference/triggerClientEvent "TriggerClientEvent")
    function that can do the reverse. You can treat this function as if it was an
    asynchronous function call, using [triggerClientEvent](/reference/triggerClientEvent
    "TriggerClientEvent") to pass back any returned information if necessary.

    Almost any data types can be passed as expected, including [elements](/reference/Element "Element") and complex nested [tables](/reference/table "Tables"). Non-element MTA data types like xmlNodes or resource pointers will not be able to be passed as they do not necessarily have a valid representation on the client. **Elements of the Vector or Matrix classes cannot be passed!**

    Events are sent reliably, so the server will receive them, but there may be (but shouldn't be) a significant delay before they are received. You should take this into account when using them.

    Keep in mind the bandwidth issues when using events - don't pass a large list of arguments unless you really need to. It **is marginally more efficient to pass one large event than two smaller ones.**
  parameters:
  - name: event
    type: string
    description: The name of the event to trigger server-side. You should register
      this event with [addEvent](/reference/addEvent "AddEvent") and add at least one event handler using [addEventHandler](/reference/addEventHandler "AddEventHandler")
      .
  - name: theElement
    type: element
    description: The element that is the [source](/reference/Event_System "Event System") of the event.
  - name: arguments
    type: mixed
    description: A list of arguments to trigger with the event. You can pass any lua
      data type (except functions). You can also pass [elements](/reference/Element "Element").
    default: 'nil'
  examples:

  returns:
    values:
    - type: bool
      name: value
    description: Returns **true** if the event trigger has been sent, **false** if invalid
      arguments were specified or a client side element was a parameter.
  notes:
  - type: info
    content: It is marginally more efficient to pass one large event than two smaller
      ones.
  - type: important
    content: 'You should use the global variable [client](/reference/Predefined_variables) server-side instead of passing
      the localPlayer by parameter or source. Otherwise event faking (passing another
      player instead of the localPlayer ) would be possible. For more information
      see: [Script security](/Script_security) article.'
  - type: important
    content: To save server CPU, you should avoid setting **theElement** to the [root](/reference/root "Root") element
      where possible - it should be used as a last resort (rather questionable thing
      to do, limited to very specific tasks, if any). Using localPlayer is preferred
      and highly advisable. [resourceRoot](/reference/resourceRoot "ResourceRoot") can also be used as alternative choice, if
      [addEventHandler](/reference/addEventHandler "addEventHandler") is bound to [root](/reference/root "Root") element, or to [resourceRoot](/reference/resourceRoot "ResourceRoot") when there is need
      to restrict event to single certain resource (although cheater could still trigger
      it from different resource, by using [getResourceRootElement](/reference/getResourceRootElement "getResourceRootElement") and passing respective
      resource root element)
