  name: triggerLatentClientEvent
  description: 'This function is the same as [[triggerClientEvent]] except the transmission rate of the data contained in the
    arguments can be limited

    and other network traffic is not blocked while the data is being transferred.'
  parameters:
  - name: sendTo
    type: 'table/element'
    description: The event will be sent to all players that are children of the specified
      element. By default this is the [root](/reference/root "Root") element, and hence the event is sent to
      all players. If you specify a single player it will just be sent to that player.
      This argument can also be a table of player elements.
    default: getRootElement()
  - name: name
    type: string
    description: The name of the event to trigger client side. You should register this event with [[addEvent]] and add at least one event handler using [[addEventHandler]].
  - name: bandwidth
    type: int
    description: The bytes per second rate to send the data contained in the arguments.
    default: '50000'
  - name: persist
    type: bool
    description: A bool indicating whether the transmission should be allowed to continue even after the resource that triggered it has since stopped.
    default: 'false'
  - name: theElement
    type: element
    description: The element that is the [source](/reference/Event_System "Event System") of the event. This could be another player, or if this isn't relevant, use the [root](/reference/root "Root") element.
  - name: arguments
    type: mixed
    description: A list of arguments to trigger with the event. You can pass any Lua data type (except functions). You can also pass [elements](/reference/Element "Element"). The total amount of data should not exceed 100MB.
    default: 'nil'
  examples:
  - path: examples/triggerLatentClientEvent-1.lua
    description: ''
  returns:
    values:
    - type: bool
      name: result
    description: Returns **true** if the event trigger has been sent, otherwise **false** if invalid arguments were specified.
  notes:
  - type: info
    content: You should avoid triggering events on the [root](/reference/root "Root") element unless you really
      need to. Doing this triggers the event on every element in the [element tree](/reference/Element_tree "Element Tree"), which is potentially very CPU intensive. Use as specific (i.e. low down the
      tree) element as you can.
