    description: The event will be sent to all players that are children of the specified

      all players. If you specify a single player it will just be sent to that player.
      This argument can also be a table of player elements.

  notes:
  - type: info
    content: You should avoid triggering events on the root element unless you really
      need to. Doing this triggers the event on every element in the element tree
      , which is potentially very CPU intensive. Use as specific (i.e. low down the
      tree) element as you can.
