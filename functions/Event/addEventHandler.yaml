  description: This function will add an [event](/wiki/Event "Event") handler. An
    event handler is a function that will be called when the event it's attached to
    is triggered. See [event system](/wiki/Event_system "Event system") for more information
    on how the event system works.

  notes:
  - type: info
    content: You shouldn't re-use the same name for your handler function as the event
      name - if multiple handler functions are used, as this can lead to confusion.
      On the same note, for multiple reasons, it isn't a good idea to export the same
      functions that you use locally as remote event handlers.
  - type: info
    content: See Event Source Element for a descriptive visualization of the event
      system handling an event trigger.
  - type: important
    content: See Script security for how-to prevent cheaters from abusing event system
      and element data .
  - type: important
    content: Anything bound to a specific element will be run before other handlers
      that are bound to something higher in the element tree (like root) This means
      that "high+10" bound to root won't trigger before "normal" bound directly to
      an element.
  - type: info
    content: Due to the additional set of global variables, the event-trigger specific
      variables it is NOT a good idea to use the same function locally as well as
      directly as an event handler . Event handlers often make use of the source element
      variable which would often find no use in generic functions. Inside of server-side
      remote event handlers it is important to add protections against exploits due
      to unexpected client event triggers or network-based load situations while generic
      functions, due to being part of a controlled call-stack, do not in general face
      the same issues. It is recommended to adapt a good-natured distancing principle
      between code meant to run from local logic in separation to code meant to run
      from remote logic.
