  name: triggerEvent
  description: This function will trigger a named [event](/reference/Event_System "Event") on
    a specific [element](/reference/Element "Element") in the [element tree](/reference/Element_tree
    "Element tree"). See [event system](/reference/Event_System "Event System") for more
    information on how the event system works.
    You can use the value returned from this function to determine if the event was cancelled by one of the event handlers. You should determine what your response (if any) to this should be based on the event's purpose. Generally, cancelling an event should prevent any further code being run that is dependent on whatever triggered that event. For example, if you have an onFlagCapture event, cancelling it would be expected to prevent the flag being able to be captured. Similarly, if you have onPlayerKill as an event you trigger, canceling it would either be expected to prevent the player being killed from dying or at least prevent the player from getting a score for it.
  parameters:
  - name: eventName
    type: string
    description: The name of the event you wish to trigger
  - name: baseElement
    type: element
    description: The element you wish to trigger the event on. See [event system](/reference/Event_System "Event System") for
      information on how this works.
  - name: arguments
    type: mixed
    description: 'The first argument that the event handler expects should be added
      after the baseElement variable. NOTE: This function can have more than one of
      these arguments specified, once for each argument the event handler is expecting.'
    default: "nil"

  returns:
    values:
    - type: bool
      name: result
    description: Returns **true** if the event was triggered successfully, otherwise **false** if the event was cancelled using [[cancelEvent]], or **nil** if the arguments are invalid or the event could not be found.

  notes:
  - type: info
    content: You should avoid triggering events on the [root](/reference/root "Root") element unless you really
      need to. Doing this triggers the event on every element in the element tree,
      which is potentially very CPU intensive. Use as specific (i.e. low down the
      tree) element as you can.
  - type: info
    content: See [Event Source Element](/reference/Event_Source_Element "Event Source Element") for a descriptive visualization of the event
      system handling an event trigger.
