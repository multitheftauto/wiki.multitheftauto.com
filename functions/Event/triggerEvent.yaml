  notes:
  - type: info
    content: You should avoid triggering events on the root element unless you really
      need to. Doing this triggers the event on every element in the element tree,
      which is potentially very CPU intensive. Use as specific (i.e. low down the
      tree) element as you can.

      system handling an event trigger.
