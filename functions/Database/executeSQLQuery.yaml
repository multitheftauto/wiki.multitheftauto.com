  name: executeSQLQuery
  description: This function executes an arbitrary SQL query and returns the result
    rows if there are any. It allows parameter binding for security ([SQL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection)
    is rendered impossible).
  parameters:
  - name: query
    type: string
    description: An SQL query. Positions where parameter values will be inserted are
      marked with a `?`.
  - name: param1 [, var param2 ... ]
    type: var
    description: |
      A variable number of parameters. These must be strings or numbers - it is important to make sure they are of the correct type. Also, the number of parameters passed must be equal to the number of `?` characters in the query string.
  
      String parameters are automatically quoted and escaped as required. (If you do not want a string quoted, use `??`). Make sure that numbers are in number format as a string number is treated differently.
  examples:
  - path: examples/executeSQLQuery-1.lua
    description: This example defines a console command that shows the ID's and names
      of all registered (stored in database) players that have more than the specified
      amount of money.
  - path: examples/executeSQLQuery-2.lua
    description: |
      This example shows the amount of money a certain registered player has.

      Notice the lack of single quotes around the `?` in this example, even though it represents a string. **executeSQLQuery** will see that the *playerName* variable is a [[string]] and take care of the correct execution of the query by itself.

      The advantage of using **executeSQLQuery** is that it is immune to users trying to exploit the query with an [SQL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) attack. *playerName* may contain special characters like `'`, `"` or `--` that will not influence the query, unlike the older approach where *playerName* would be concatenated into the query string.
  returns:
    values:
    - type: table|false
      name: result
    description: |
      Returns a [[table]] with the result of the query if it was a SELECT
      query, or **false** if otherwise. In case of a SELECT query the result table may
      be empty (if there are no result rows). The table is of the form:

      <br/>
      The table is of the format<br/>
      <code>
      {
        { colname1=value1, colname2=value2, ... },
        { colname1=value3, colname2=value4, ... },
        ...
      }
      </code>
  notes:
  - type: info
    content: This function only acts upon `registry.db`. Use [[dbQuery]] to query a custom
      SQL database.
