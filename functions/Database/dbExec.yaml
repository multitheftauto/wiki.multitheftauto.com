server:
  name: dbExec
  description: This function executes a database query using the supplied connection. No query result is returned.
  parameters:
  - name: databaseConnection
    type: db-connection
    description: A database connection element previously returned from [[dbConnect]].
  - name: query
    type: string
    description: An SQL query. Positions where parameter values will be inserted are marked with a `?`.
  - name: param1 [, var param2 ...]
    type: var
    description: |
      A variable number of parameters. These must be strings or numbers - it is important to make sure they are of the correct type. Also, the number of parameters passed must be equal to the number of `?` characters in the query string.
  
      String parameters are automatically quoted and escaped as required. (If you do not want a string quoted, use `??`). Make sure that numbers are in number format as a string number is treated differently.

  notes:
  - type: tip
    content: The server command [debugdb 2](/articles/Server_Commands#debugdb) will output verbose information on each query to a logging file (usually `logs/db.log`).
  - type: tip
    content:  It is usually good practice to surround table and column names with backticks (`) in case they contain spaces or SQL keywords (and therefore cause syntax errors). This is especially true when using variables for table and column names, as potential problems may not be apparent when the script is first written.
