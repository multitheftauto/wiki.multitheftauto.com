  description: This function returns three floats containing the velocity (movement
    speeds) along the X, Y, and Z axis respectively. This means that velocity values
    can be positive and negative for each axis.
  parameters:
  - name: theElement
    type: element
    description: The element you wish to retrieve the velocity of.

    description: If succesful, returns three float s that represent the element's
      current velocity along the x , y , and z axis respectively. This function can
      fail if the element is a player in a car. Use the vehicle element in this case.
      It will also fail if the element specified does not have a velocity, or does
      not exist. In case of failure, the first return value will be false .
