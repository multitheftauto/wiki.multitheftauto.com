  name: isElementVisibleTo
  description: This checks if an element is visible to a player. This does not check if the player can literally see the element, just that they are aware that it exists. Some so-called per-player elements are able to be visible only to some players (see [[Visibility]]), as such this checks if this is the case for a particular element/player combination.

  - name: theElement
    type: element
    description: The element you want to check the visibility of.
