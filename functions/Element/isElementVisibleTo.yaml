  description: This checks if an element is visible to a player. This does not check
    if the player can literally see the element, just that they are aware that it
    exists. Some so\-called [per\-player elements](/wiki/Per-player_elements?action=edit&redlink=1
    "Per-player elements (page does not exist)") are able to be visible only to some
    players, as such this checks if this is the case for a particular element/player
    combination.
