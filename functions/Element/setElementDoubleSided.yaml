  name: setElementDoubleSided
  description: This function allows you to set the double\-sidedness of an element's
    model. When an element's model is double\-sided, it's back facing triangles become
    visible. See [what is back-face culling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-face_culling).
  parameters:
  - name: theElement
    type: element
    description: The element in which you'd like to set the double-sidedness of.
  - name: enable
    type: bool
    description: Set to true/false to enable/disable double-sidedness.

    values:
    - type: bool
      name: result
    description: Returns **true** if theElement is valid, **false** otherwise.

        Possible uses of double-sidedness are: Elimination of invisible walls, using buildings as enclosures, using inverted landmasses as large pits or to make cave networks. 
        It can also remove the need to add extra triangles to custom models when trying to make them appear solid from all directions.
