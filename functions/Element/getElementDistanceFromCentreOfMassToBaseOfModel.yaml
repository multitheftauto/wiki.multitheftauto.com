  name: getElementDistanceFromCentreOfMassToBaseOfModel
  description: This function is used to retrieve the distance between a [[element]]'s centre of mass to the base of the model. This can be used to calculate
    the position the [[element]] has to be set to, to have
    it on ground level.
  parameters:
  - name: theElement
    type: element
    description: The element you want to retrieve the value of.
  examples:
  - path: examples/getElementDistanceFromCentreOfMassToBaseOfModel-1.lua
    description: This example outputs the value for the local player.
  - path: examples/getElementDistanceFromCentreOfMassToBaseOfModel_OOP-1.lua
    description: This example outputs the value for the local player.
    oop: true
  returns:
    values:
    - type: float|false
      name: Distance from centre of mass to base model.
    description: Returns a [[float]] with the distance, or **false** if the element is invalid.
  oop:
    element: element
    method: getDistanceFromCentreOfMassToBaseOfModel
    variable: distanceFromCentreOfMassToBaseOfModel
    static: false
  notes:
  - type: info
    content: The distance value is only available when the element is streamed in,
      otherwise 0 is returned. If you create an element at the player's position which
      is going to be streamed in, call the function in the next frame to obtain the
      correct value (with [[setTimer]] 0ms, for example).
