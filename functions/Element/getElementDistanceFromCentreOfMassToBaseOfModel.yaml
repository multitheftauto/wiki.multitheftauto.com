  name: getElementDistanceFromCentreOfMassToBaseOfModel
  description: This function is used to retrieve the distance between a [element](/wiki/Element
    "Element")'s centre of mass to the base of the model. This can be used to calculate
    the position the [element](/wiki/Element "Element") has to be set to, to have
    it on ground level.
  parameters: []
  examples:
  - path: examples/getElementDistanceFromCentreOfMassToBaseOfModel-1.lua
    description: This example outputs the value for the local player.
    side: client
  notes:
  - type: info
    content: The distance value is only available when the element is streamed in,
      otherwise 0 is returned. If you create an element at the player's position which
      is going to be streamed in, call the function in the next frame to obtain the
      correct value (with setTimer 0ms, for example).
