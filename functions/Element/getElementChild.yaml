      If the .map file contains:

      ```xml
      <team1 id="red">
        <base name="Mountain Top" />
        <base name="Docks" />
        <base name="Airport" />
      </team1>
      ```

      Note that if there are other child elements, you'd have to check whether the element is a base with the [[getElementType]] function.
      ```xml
      <team1 id="red">
        <base name="Mountain Top" />
        <base name="Docks" />
        <base name="Airport" />
        <target name="Factory" />
      </team1>
      ```

      For example: `teamBase 3` would output `Team Base 3: Factory` with the .map file below, even though it's no base.

      This outputs the name of the specified base. For example: `teamBase 0` for the first base.
