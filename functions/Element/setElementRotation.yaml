  - name: theElement
    type: element
    description: The element whose rotation will be set.
  - name: rotX
    type: float
    description: The element's rotation around the x axis in degrees.

    description: The element's rotation around the y axis in degrees.
  - name: rotZ
    type: float
    description: The element's rotation around the z axis in degrees.
  - name: rotOrder
    type: string
    description: A [[string]] representing the rotation order desired when interpreting the provided euler angles.

  - name: conformPedRotation
    type: bool
    description: Relevant **only for peds** and will be ignored for other element types. A bool which should be set to **true** to ensure the ped rotation is correctly set in all circumstances. Failing to set this argument may result in the ped rotation being inverted whilst it is in the air and other inconsistencies. The default value of **false** is for backward compatibility with scripts which may depend upon the incorrect behaviour.
    default: 'false'

    values:
    - type: bool
      name: result
    description: Returns **true** if the element rotation was successfully set and **false**
      otherwise.

  notes:
    - type: info
      content: |
        - This function does not work on [[colshape]] and dummy-elements created by [[createElement]].
        - The default rotation order for peds/players is `Z-Y-X` (**clientside**) and `-Z-Y-X` (**serverside**) but those rotation orders (set using "default" on peds) can not be used manually on other element types since they only exist due to historical and backward compatibility reasons. Specifying a rotation order other than `default` allows the same angles to later be uniformly used on several elements without having to consider their type.
    - type: tip
      content: New scripts should set `conformPedRotation` to **true** when using this function on peds. This will prevent quirky old behaviour.
