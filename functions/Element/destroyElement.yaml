server:
  name: destroyElement
  description: This function destroys an [element](/wiki/Element "Element") and all
    elements within it in the hierarchy (its children, the children of those children
    etc). [Player](/wiki/Player "Player") elements cannot be destroyed using this
    function. A player can only be removed from the hierarchy when they quit or are
    kicked. The root element also cannot be destroyed, however, passing the root as
    an argument will wipe all elements from the server, except for the players and
    clients, which will become direct descendants of the root node, and other elements
    that cannot be destroyed, such as resource root elements.

    description: Example 1:This example would destroy every element in the map, with
      the exception of players and the root element itself.

  notes:
  - type: info
    content: There is bug when you try to destroy webbrowser that returned from guiGetBrowser
      so instead of that destroy the gui-element one that returned from guiCreateBrowser
      otherwise the game will be crushed (By Master_MTA).
  - type: info
    content: As element ids are eventually recycled, always make sure you nil variables
      containing the element after calling this function
  - type: info
    content: If a streamed-in element is destroyed then it is NOT streamed out, i.e.
      the onClientElementStreamOut client-side event is NOT triggered. Thus it is
      wrong to assume a clean stream-in and stream-out sequence on the client-side.
      Additionally to onClientElementStreamOut use a onClientElementDestroy event
      handler to detect the destruction of streamed-in elements.
