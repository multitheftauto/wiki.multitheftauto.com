    description: This example puts all vehicles with drivers in dimension 1, while all other vehicles are in dimension 0. This would have the effect of making on-foot players invisible to drivers, and vice versa. It'd also make entering a vehicle as passenger after the driver has entered impossible, as the vehicle would appear to vanish to any on foot players.
