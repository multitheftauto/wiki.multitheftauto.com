  description: This function is used to determine if an element is within a collision
    shape. Please note that for legacy reasons, a colshape created on the client does
    not collide with elements already existing at that location until they first move.
    Please also note that before 1\.0\.3, this did not function correctly when moving
    a colshape.
  parameters: []

    description: This small script is an example of detecting if a player is within
      a certain defined colshape. This could serve as a base to perform many functions,
      rather than just an output.
