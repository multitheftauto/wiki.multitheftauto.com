client:
  name: setElementData
  description: This function stores [element data](/wiki/Element_data "Element data")
    under a certain key, attached to an element. Element data set using this is then
    synced with all clients and the server. The data can contain server\-created elements,
    but you should avoid passing data that is not able to be synced such as xmlnodes,
    acls, aclgroups etc.
  parameters:
  - name: theElement
    type: element
    description: The element you wish to attach the data to.
  - name: key
    type: string
    description: The key you wish to store the data under. (Maximum 128 characters.)
  - name: value
    type: var
    description: The value you wish to store. See element data for a list of acceptable
      datatypes.
  - name: synchronize
    type: bool
    description: Determines whether or not the data will be synchronized with the
      server.
    default: 'true'

    values:

  - type: info
    content: See Script security for tips on preventing cheaters when using events
      and element data.
  - type: info
    content: For performance reasons, never use setElementData in events that fire
      often (like onClientRender ) without further optimization or conditions. In
      fact, using element data in general, can take such a toll on performance that
      not using it unless strictly necessary (e.g use alternatives such as storing
      data in tables) is recommended.
  - type: tip
    content: A simple and efficient way to make a variable known to the server and
      clients is to use setElementData on the root element.
