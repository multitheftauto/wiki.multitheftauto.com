server:
  name: setElementData
  description: This function stores [element data](/wiki/Element_data "Element data")
    under a certain key, attached to an element. Element data set using this is then
    synced with all clients and the server. The data can contain server\-created elements,
    but you should avoid passing data that is not able to be synced such as xmlnodes,
    acls, aclgroups etc.

    description: This example allows a player to add a custom tag onto their nickname,
      and also reverts it back to normal if they wish.

  notes:
  - type: info
    content: See Script security for tips on preventing cheaters when using events
      and element data.
  - type: info
    content: For performance reasons, never use setElementData in events that fire
      often (like onClientRender ) without further optimization or conditions. In
      fact, using element data in general, can take such a toll on performance that
      not using it unless strictly necessary (e.g use alternatives such as storing
      data in tables) is recommended.
  - type: tip
    content: A simple and efficient way to make a variable known to the server and
      clients is to use setElementData on the root element.
