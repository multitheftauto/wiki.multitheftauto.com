  description: This function updates GTA bone animation for a given [element](/wiki/Element
    "Element"). Currently the [Player](/wiki/Element/Player "Element/Player") and
    [Ped](/wiki/Element/Ped "Element/Ped") element types are accepted. It must be
    called after [setElementBoneRotation](/wiki/SetElementBoneRotation "SetElementBoneRotation")
    for changes to take effect. It should only be called once per frame, after you
    are done rotating bones on that element, as it is quite heavy.
