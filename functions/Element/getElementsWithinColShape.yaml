  notes:
  - type: info
    content: |
      - For legacy reasons, a colshape created on the client does not collide
      with elements already existing at that location until they first move.
      - This function doesn't verify whether elements are in the same dimension and interior,
      additional checks could be implemented manually if they are needed.
