  description: This function is used to retrieve a list of the child elements of a
    given parent element. Note that it will only return direct children and not elements
    that are further down the [element tree](/reference/Element_tree).
  parameters:
  - name: parent
    type: element
    description: Supply this argument with the parent of the children you want returned.
  - name: theType
    type: string
    description: 'The type of element you want a list of. This is the same as the
      tag name in the .map file, so this can be used with a custom element type if
      desired. See [element types](/reference/Element).'

    values:
    - type: table|false
      name: childrens
    description: This function returns a [[table]] that contains a list of elements that
      the parent has. If the element has no children, it will return an empy [[table]]. It will return **false** if the parent element does not exist.

      With this map file:

      ```xml
      <team1 id="red">
        <base name="Mountain Top" />
        <base name="Docks" />
        <base name="Airport" />
        <anything name="no base" />
      </team1>
      ```

      This example outputs the child elements of the element with id `red`, when the player enters the `teamElements` command. At a later point you could loop through all the elements and process their contents any way you wish. Remember to make sure you only have the current list of elements though. If you get the [[root]] element children, then wait a while for things to change, this list won't be up to date unless you use **getElementChildren** again.
