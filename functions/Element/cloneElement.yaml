        - if `cloneChildren` is **true**, the position floats will be offsets from the cloned element's position.
        - The root node, and player elements, cannot be cloned. If a player element is a child of an element that is cloned, it will be skipped, along with the elements that exist as a child to the player element. Players are not the only elements that cannot be cloned. This list also includes remoteclients, and console elements.
        - The cloned element will be placed on the [element tree](/reference/Element_tree) as a child of the same parent as the cloned element.
