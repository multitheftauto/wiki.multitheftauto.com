client:
  name: setElementStreamable
  description: This function can be used to disable streaming for an element. This
    will make sure the element is not virtualized (streamed out from GTA) when the
    player moves far away from it. This function only works in elements with a physical
    representation in the world (entities), such as [[player]], [[ped]], [[vehicle]] and [[object]].
  parameters:
  - name: theElement
    type: element
    description: The element you wish to set the streaming of.
  - name: streamable
    type: bool
    description: Set **true** if this element should stream in/out like normal, **false** if it
      should always be streamed in.
  examples:
  - path: examples/setElementStreamable-1.lua
    description: This example creates an objectat the center of the map which will always be streamed in when the resource which contains it starts.
  - path: examples/setElementStreamable_OOP-1.lua
    description: This example creates an objectat the center of the map which will always be streamed in when the resource which contains it starts.

    values:
    - type: bool
      name: result
    description: Returns whether the element could be set to be streamable.

      **Always use this function with caution.** Not doing so can cause the following problems:

      - There is a limit of elements that can be streamed in safely for every GTA entity type. If you bypass said limit by using this function, the client can experience problems of disappearing objects and unstability when trying to stream in new elements of that type.
      - In general, if you disable too many elements (of the same type or not) to stream out, GTA will always try to render them, so it can cause a noticeable FPS drop.
