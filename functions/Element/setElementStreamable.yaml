  description: This function can be used to disable streaming for an element. This
    will make sure the element is not virtualized (streamed out from GTA) when the
    player moves far away from it. This function only works in elements with a physical
    representation in the world (entities), such as [players](/wiki/Player "Player"),
    [peds](/wiki/Ped "Ped"), [vehicles](/wiki/Vehicle "Vehicle") and [objects](/wiki/Object
    "Object").
  parameters: []

      always be streamed in when the resource which contains it starts.

  notes:
  - type: tip
    content: 'Always use this function with caution . Not doing so can cause the following
      problems: There is a limit of elements that can be streamed in safely for every
      GTA entity type. If you bypass said limit by using this function, the client
      can experience problems of disappearing objects and unstability when trying
      to stream in new elements of that type. In general, if you disable too many
      elements (of the same type or not) to stream out, GTA will always try to render
      them, so it can cause a noticeable FPS drop.'
