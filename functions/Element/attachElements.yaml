  notes:
  - type: info
    content: The offset coodinates reflect the object space, not the world space.
      This means that you cannot calculate the exact offsets between two objects by
      pre-positioning them in the map editor as a reference. Please see attachElementsOffsets
      for more details. Due to a limitation in GTA, unexpected attach rotations may
      occur if all rotation offsets are non-zero. (i.e. Try to ensure at least one
      of 'xRotOffset', 'yRotOffset' or 'zRotOffset' is zero).
