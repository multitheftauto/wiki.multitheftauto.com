  name: getElementsByType
  description: This function is used to retrieve a list of all elements of the specified
    type. This can be useful, as it disregards *where* in the element tree it is.
    It can be used with either the built in types or with any custom
    type used in a .map file. For example, if there is an element of type "flag" (e.g.
    \<flag /\>) in the .map file, the using "flag" as the type argument would find
    it.
  parameters:
  - name: theType
    type: string
    description: The type of element you want a list of. This is the same as the tag name in the .map file, so this can be used with a custom element type if desired. See [element types](/reference/Element).
