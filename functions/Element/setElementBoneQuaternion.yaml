  name: setElementBoneQuaternion
  pair: getElementBoneQuaternion
  description: This function determines how a particular bone rotates in relation to the element. This can be a [[player]] or [[ped]].
  parameters:
  - name: ped
    type: element
    description: The element on which the bone's rotation will be set.
  - name: bone
    type: int
    description: The ID of the bone to set the quaternion of. See [Bone IDs](/reference/ID_Lists/Bones).
  - name: x
    type: float
    description: The quaternion's coefficient of the 𝑖 component, representing rotation around the x-axis.
  - name: "y"
    type: float
    description: The quaternion's coefficient of the 𝑗 component, representing rotation around the y-axis.
  - name: z
    type: float
    description: The quaternion's coefficient of the 𝑘 component, representing rotation around the z-axis.
  - name: w
    type: float
    description: The real part of the quaternion, which is linked to the angle of rotation.
  examples:
  - path: examples/setElementBoneQuaternion-1.lua
    description: This example rotates the player's pelvis 180 degrees around an arbitrary
      axis. The use of [[updateElementRpHAnim]] is necessary here as it applies the rotation.
  returns:
    values:
    - type: bool
      name: result
    description: Returns **true** if the set was successful, otherwise returns **false**.
  notes:
  - type: info
    content: If you want to apply the rotation, [[updateElementRpHAnim]] must be called
      after this function.

      - The use of [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion) are more effective and do not generate issues like [gimbal lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock) that might arise with [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles), so they are a preferable choice for rotation.
      - If you want to attach an element to a bone, see [pAttach](https://github.com/Patrick2562/mtasa-pAttach).
