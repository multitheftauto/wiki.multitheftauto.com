  description: "This function determines how a particular bone rotates in relation\
    \ to the element.  \n\nThe use of [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion)\
    \ are more effective and do not generate issues like gimbal lock that might arise\
    \ with [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles), so they are\
    \ a preferable choice for rotation."
  parameters:
  - name: ped
    type: element
    description: The element (ped or player) on which the bone's rotation will be
      set.
  - name: bone
    type: int
    description: The ID of the bone to set the quaternion of.

    description: This example rotates the player's pelvis 180 degrees around an arbitrary
      axis.The use ofupdateElementRpHAnimis necessary here as it applies the rotation.

    values:
    - type: bool
      name: value
    description: Returns true if the set was successful, otherwise returns an error
      message and returns false .
  notes:
  - type: info
    content: If you want to apply the rotation, updateElementRpHAnim must be called
      after this function.
  - type: tip
    content: If you want to attach an element to a bone, see attachElementToBone .
