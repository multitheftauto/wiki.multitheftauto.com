  name: getElementBoneQuaternion
  pair: setElementBoneQuaternion
  description: This function retrieves how a particular bone rotates in relation to the element. This can be a [[player]] or [[ped]].
  parameters:
  - name: ped
    type: element
    description: The element from which the bone's rotation will be retrieved.
  - name: bone
    type: int
    description: The ID of the bone to retrieve the quaternion of. See [Bone IDs](/reference/ID_Lists/Bones).
  examples:
  - path: examples/getElementBoneQuaternion-1.lua
    description: This example retrieves the rotation of the player's head in quaternion. The retrieved values can be used for calculations.
  returns:
    values:
    - type: float|false
      name: The quaternion's coefficient of the 𝑖 component, representing rotation around the x-axis.
    - type: float
      name: The quaternion's coefficient of the 𝑗 component, representing rotation around the y-axis.
    - type: float
      name: The quaternion's coefficient of the 𝑘 component, representing rotation around the z-axis.
    - type: float
      name: The real part of the quaternion, which is linked to the angle of rotation.
    description: 'Returns four floats: x, y, z, w, or **false** if invalid arguments were passed.'
  notes:
    - type: tip
      content: The use of [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion) are more effective and do not generate issues like [gimbal lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock) that might arise with [Euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles), so they are a preferable choice for rotation.
