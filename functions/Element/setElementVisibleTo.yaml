  notes:
    - type: info
      content: |
        - Visibility settings of lower elements in the element tree override higher ones - if visibility for root is set to false and for a player is set to true, it will be visible to the player.
        - Setting visibility for one element will also set visibility for all of its children. Order of **setElementVisibleTo** calls doesn't matter.
    - type: tip
      content: |
        - If you want to clear all visibility settings of an element, try [[clearElementVisibleTo]].
        - If the element doesn't need to exist on the server side, you can simply create it on the client side (for example, a [[blip]]). In that case, you don't need to use this function, because only the client on which the element was created will see it.
