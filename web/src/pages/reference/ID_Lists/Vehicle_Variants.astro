        Vehicle variants can be anything from different adverts to additional parts of the model. Related functions: <a href="/reference/setVehicleVariant">setVehicleVariant</a>, <a href="/reference/getVehicleVariant">getVehicleVariant</a> and <a href="/reference/createVehicle">createVehicle</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Adding Variants</h3>
    <p>Adding variants requires modifying your <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/DFF" target="_blank">DFF</a> by adding a part of the model you wish to be a variant and naming it <strong>extra1</strong>, <strong>extra2</strong>, <strong>extra3</strong>, <strong>extra4</strong>, or <strong>extra5</strong> then setting its parent to the <strong>chassis_dummy</strong>; this tells GTA it has variant information.</p>

    <h3>Spawning Custom Variants</h3>
    <p>To spawn custom variants is to implicitly specify which variants you want in <a href="/reference/createVehicle">createVehicle</a>, or change the variant of an already existing vehicle using <a href="/reference/setVehicleVariant">setVehicleVariant</a>. Also, any invalid variant will show up as the default model with no variation.</p>
