    <p><strong>Multi Theft Auto</strong> has loads of areas in which you can help. In turn, we'll be more than happy to help you get started with any ideas you have, help test them and - if they're good enough - release them to the whole community. This page outlines the key areas you could do something in, of course, there are many things we've not thought of, so think outside the box!</p>

    </li>
    <li>Any bugs which are related to a scripting function/event and present in the main release (rather than nightlies), document that bug by adding an <strong>issue</strong> to the wiki page to save other scripters a lot of time.
