  description: 'This example sends whitelist requests on demand, which means whenever
    a blocked domain is detected/queried by the user.

    It''s also a good alternative to requesting CEF domains on server join, because
    this is less intrusive and requests will only be sent as soon the player starts
    interacting with a browser script.'
