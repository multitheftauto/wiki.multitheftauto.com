description: This event is triggered whenever a physical element is streamed in. This
  is triggered for all elements that are streamable, such as players, peds, vehicles,
  objects and markers. When this event is triggered, that element is guaranteed to
  be physically created as a GTA object.

notes:
- type: info
  content: This event also triggers for a remote player that dies in front of local
    player, even if they respawn far away.. the moment they do so, this event will
    be triggered, and if you'd measure distance between local and said remote player
    (that spawned far away) during this event, it would output the distance at which
    they died in front of local player, e.g 2 metres. This is bug-prone behavior and
    likely incorrect, to be fixed in the future, but for now be aware. The 'low distance'
    aspect of this (which could worsen your results) is caused by the split second
    that their ped elements may 'flash' past its wasted location during the respawning
    process. For now you can work around these side effect (both, or the distance
    aspect.. results may vary based on randomness) by adding an isPedDead check inside
    the event, checking source (said remote player), as this delays the onClientElementIn
    until after full respawn has taken place. The below script example incorporates
    this workaround
