  description: The source of this event is the element that streamed out.
description: This event is triggered whenever a physical element is streamed out.
  This is triggered for all elements that are streamable, such as players, peds, vehicles,
  objects and markers when the local player is leaving the element. When this event
  is triggered, that element is no longer physical and is now virtualized by MTA.

  description: This example shows you how to tell player that another player was streamed
    out and the distance between them and said player
  side: client
notes:
- type: info
  content: Be aware that this event triggers for local player (as itself being the
    element that got streamed out) when said local player dies and respawns, as this
    is the removal & recreation of entity local ped.
- type: info
  content: This event is not triggered for elements that are streamed-in at the point
    of a destroyElement call. Use the onClientElementDestroy event in combination
    with the isElementStreamedIn function to handle such a case.
