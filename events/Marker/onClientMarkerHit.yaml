description: This event is triggered when a player enters a marker created using [createMarker](/wiki/CreateMarker
  "CreateMarker").

  description: This code will output a message to the chatbox whenever any player
    walks into any marker.
  side: client
notes:
- type: important
  content: The event is not triggered when only the dimension changes of the player.
    So, if you use the `matchingDimension` when teleporting players into existing
    markers you should always first set their dimension/interior and only then the
    position
