canceling: If this event is canceled, the game's chat system won't deliver the posts.
  You may use outputChatBox to send the messages then. Cancelling this event also
  means the chat will not appear in the server console or logs. If you want chat logging,
  you will have to add a call to outputServerLog - See the second example.
