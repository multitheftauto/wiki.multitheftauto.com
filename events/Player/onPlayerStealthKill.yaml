  description: 'This example will prevent the stealthkill animation of the attacker
    as it occurs, something which is tricky to achieve (hence this example is extra
    useful).

    Note: you won''t get this to work properly without timer and ''fake'' animation.
    Lots of scripters have broken their backs over this.'
