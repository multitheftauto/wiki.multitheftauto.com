  type: element
  description: The source of this event is the player who tried to execute a command.
description: This event is triggered when a player issues a command.
parameters:
- name: command
  type: string
  description: a string containing the name of the command executed.
examples:
- path: examples/onPlayerCommand-1.lua
  description: This example implements an anti-flood protection timer for commands.Be
    sure to give the resource a function.kickPlayer right.Also, note, that if the
    server freezes for a frame and a player executes a command 2x he/she'll get kicked,
    because those 2 commands will be processed after each other, with very little
    delay
  side: server
- path: examples/onPlayerCommand-2.lua
  description: Time limit specific commands.
  side: server
canceling: The command will not be executed. (Only server-side commands can be canceled.)
notes:
- type: info
  content: This event triggers regardless of whether the command exists in a script
    or is hardcoded. Also, typing anything in chat will execute the internal command
    "say", so this event will be triggered on every chat message as well. Therefore
    you should avoid excessive use of this function on busy servers, out of performance
    considerations.
