  description: The source of this event is the player who triggered the teleport detection.
description: This event is triggered when a player's position changes significantly
  without direct server intervention, such as the use of [setElementPosition](/wiki/SetElementPosition
  "SetElementPosition"). When the player synchronizes data with the server, the server
  monitors player positions to detect significant unexpected movements. If a player's
  position deviates beyond the established threshold without server functions like
  [setElementPosition](/wiki/SetElementPosition "SetElementPosition") being used,
  this event will be triggered.
