description: |
  A **browser** is an element representing a CEF browser instance, created with [createBrowser](/reference/createBrowser/) or [guiCreateBrowser](/reference/guiCreateBrowser/). This element also simultaneously represents the browserâ€™s [texture](/reference/texture/), so it can be used as a texture, e.g. for rendering with [dxDrawImage](/reference/dxDrawImage/).
