  The **account** class represents a [[player]]'s server account. You can get the **account** object associated to any client using [[getPlayerAccount]].

  Accounts are unique to each client and can be used to store information that is persistent across map changes and user sessions. Clients that join without an account are given a temporary 'guest' account. This can store information like any other account, but isn't saved across sessions.

  When a user logs in or out, the account object assigned to them will change. As such, you must not assume that the account attached to a client remains constant during their session.

  PHP code to check password hashes from the MTA server database is

  <details>
    <summary>Here</summary>
    This php function will return true if the password matches the hash from the accounts database.

    ```php
    function passwordMatch( $plain, $hash )
    {
      //-- Empty passwords never match
      if ( $plain == "" || $hash == "" )
        return false;

      if ( strlen($hash) == 64 + 32 + 1 )
      {
        //-- SHA256 + type + salt
        $strSha256 = substr( $hash, 0, 64 );
        $strType = substr( $hash, 64, 1 );
        $strSalt = substr( $hash, 65, 32 );

        //-- Password hash was generated from MD5, so do the same thing for the test
        if ( $strType == "1" )
          $plain = strtoupper(md5($plain));

        $strPasswordHashed = strtoupper(hash( "sha256", $strSalt . $plain ));
        return $strPasswordHashed == $strSha256;
      }
      else
      if ( strlen($hash) == 32 )
      {
        //-- MD5
        return strtoupper(md5($plain)) == $hash;
      }
      return false;
    }
    ```
