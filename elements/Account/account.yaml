  The **account** class represents a [player](/player)'s server account. You can get the **account** object associated to any client using [getPlayerAccount](/getPlayerAccount).

  Accounts are unique to each client and can be used to store information that is persistent across map changes and user sessions. Clients that join without an account are given a temporary 'guest' account. This can store information like any other account, but isn't saved across sessions.

  When a user logs in or out, the account object assigned to them will change. As such, you must not assume that the account attached to a client remains constant during their session.

  PHP code to check password hashes from the MTA server database is [here](/Account_PHP).
