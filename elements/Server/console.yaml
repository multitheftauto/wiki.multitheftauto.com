  The Server Console class represents the server console.

  In the server console you can use many different commands, affecting the players using the server. Please note that only console commands can be used, and that some commands can not be used through the in-game client console, only through the Server Console. 

  You can view all latest available server console commands by entering **"help"** into the server console window.
