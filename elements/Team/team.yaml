name: 'team'
description: |
  The team class represents player teams. Players on the same team can use team features such as teamchat or friendly fire.

  A common misconception is that players would be child elements of team elements. This is wrong. Being part of a team is merely a relational connection rather than a change in element hierarchy. To perform logic on all the players of a team you have to use the [getPlayersInTeam](/getPlayersInTeam) function.
