  ACL or Access Control List is a set of rights grouped together to create a list, they are defined in the [ACL.xml](/Access_Control_List) file as <acl> nodes. These ACLs can then be added to certain [ACL Groups](/aclgroup) to grant or deny these groups specified permissions or acces to server scripting functions defined in the ACL. Example of an ACL:

  ```xml
  <acl name="Example">
    <right name="general.ModifyOtherObjects" access="true" />
    <right name="function.startResource" access="true" />
    <right name="function.stopResource" access="true" />
    <right name="function.shutdown" access="false" />
    <right name="command.shutdown" access="false" />
  </acl>
  ```

  This creates ACL called *Example* and gives resources access to start/stop resources and modify other resources but denies access to shutting down the server. Players that are in group using this ACL will be denied access to `shutdown` command.
