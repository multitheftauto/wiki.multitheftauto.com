  The IFP class represents an archive that stores animations for peds and objects. A single IFP file can contain multiple different animations. 
  An IFP file can be loaded using [[engineLoadIFP]], after which you can either replace an existing animation using [[engineReplaceAnimation]] or use entirely new custom animations.
