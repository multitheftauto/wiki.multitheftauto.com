description: |
  The sound element represents a custom sound sent to the client via the use of the file parameter inside the meta file and created either by [playSound](/playSound) or [playSound3D](/playSound3D). 

  A sound element can be manipulated in the GTA 3D world via [setElementPosition](/setElementPosition) and [setElementDimension](/setElementDimension).

  Sound elements can also be manipulated using the other [Client audio functions](/client_audio_functions).
