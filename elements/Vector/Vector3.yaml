    description: >
      This example creates a tiny sun which is always at the right of the vehicle the local player drives. By default it will draw the vectors used to compute the position where it should be, so you can understand what does this function do. Note that the code could be made simpler by simply getting the right component of the vehicle matrix. Make sure that you put this code in a resource which has OOP enabled, or it won't work.
